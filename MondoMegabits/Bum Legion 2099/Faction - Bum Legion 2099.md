# TONIGHT, THEY FIGHT.

A 600 year-old jailed cryo-bum is broken out of stasis by his comrades, seconds after waking up he's asking for **jenkem** and **whippets**. The reunited squad heads to the latrine to do a bit of heroin and clean up — a long night awaits. Tonight, they take back **LIVING QUARTERS B and C** from their oppressors.

The crew aboard the 2MASX SUPERSHIP is fractured. The longer the ship has been afloat, the fewer and fewer **resources** remain.

The fewer the resources, the more **resourceful** the BUM LEGION has become.

They manufacture hard drugs out of **shit**, **piss** and **cleaning chemicals**. They manufacture weapons out of **shit**, **piss** and **cleaning chemicals**.

The rumblings of revolution can be heard on the lower levels, but the tone is different from that of the engine hum seated nearby. It's an angry, violent hymnal. The despots have less and less to lose with each passing synthetic day-night cycle. MORE AND MORE MIDDLE CLASS CREW MEMBERS ARE PUSHED TO HOMELESSNESS AS THEIR PODLETS ARE RECLAIMED FOR **DOLBY DIGITAL SURROUND SOUND VR MOVIE THEATERS FOR THE 1%**.

THE BUM LEGION MAY NOT BE SHARP, THEY MAY NOT BE CAPABLE OF DOING MUCH BESIDES GUERILLA ACTIVITY AND SMOKING CIGS...

— but God damn it, they're people too.
