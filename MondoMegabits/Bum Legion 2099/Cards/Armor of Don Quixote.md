Dumpster Armor. Strangely effective.. Slow, encumbering, putrid, but impervious to small arms fire. Creatures can turtleshell into their trashcan armor and take no damage from explosives. While hiding within the dumpster armor, you have a small chance of finding goodies within- like a shit covered cigaratte, or a shit plastered diaper.
