"Every hero has a sidekick." That's why you smoke it, to unlock your inner Batman and Tony Stark. This is your superpower, this is your universe - Like a Marvel or D.C Universe.. No one can take from you what you've already taken from yourself. Is it hot in here or is it just me. Does anyone wanna go for a walk to the Walmart 6 miles away. 

---------------------------------------- 
Tweaked: Just a puff. One creature may now attack twice in one turn, for two (2) turns. But: (slight drawback!) meth smoking creature must steal antique jewelry from a friendly creature and sell at 10% of its real value at the pawn shop next to the Long John Silver's. 
♦ Walmart (3-mile walk): "Know a cashier that I can toss a dimebag to and she'll let us walk right outta there with Blu-rays and Unda Ahma'. She don't work Sattadays." 

♦ Cheesecake Factory (7-mile power walk): "Dine and dash is mad easy here just sit close to the exit, I always ask for this specific table. Easy." 

♦ ExxonMobil (11-mile wind sprint): "Best place to ask for money around 7:00 AM—all the officeworkas from around the corner are stopping in to get coffee. They also sell steel wool and all the cool shit we smoke with." 

♦ "Iron Man, Batman, Hulk, Tony Stark, Deadpool—he's my favorite. I'm literally just like Deadpool kid." Muttered in a nervous shaky pattern as you walk out of Wal-Mart with a shoplifted Deadpool Snapback and a bag of Jack Links, then you get in a heated dispute with some cigarette bitch that's nodding off on your bicycle.
