#### "The Telekinetic Knights were once said to own every dumpster in Old York" - Source Unknown 

The TK Knight is a telekinetic super-paladin, a personal guard of the high priests, trained by those very priests. Specializes in telepathy, mind control, stacking cups with the mind and unstacking them and collapsing them really fast. TK Knight isn't only a mind pirate, he is also a skilled physical battler but prefers to keep them at jousting pole distance.
