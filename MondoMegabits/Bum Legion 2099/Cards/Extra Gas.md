"Oh you're on fumes ya' say? Shit, I got some extra." 
Tactic Devised by: Louis James Ferg, 51, Bum Army Gunner Sgt. City Slickers Victimized by Shit Prank: 21 Grade: 93 Fecal Extra Gas is a sardonic trap card. 
Enemy creature needs gas on the side of the road, you need a sick thrill. 
The exchange goes like this: "Hey buddy, I'm all outta gas you happen to have an extra Jerry in that RV of yours? I can pay, I'm in a pinch." 
"Gas.. Uh, yeah. Yeah I got gas. Gotta hook a tube into my reserve tank, pull your car up next to mine."
"Woah, for real? Damn man thank you. Long road to Kansas City, I got a conference at the community center. Thanks to you I'm gonna make it. Sick! So uh, we syphoning gas here?' 
"Something like that. just pull her around." 
Bum hooks his waste tank up and fills your Kia Soul with 55 lbs of pavement temperature feces and piss, saved up from the last 12 days of doing salvia on the interstate emergency lane. 
"Gee, thanks. How much do I owe you, stranger?" 
"Not a thing. Just pay it forward."
