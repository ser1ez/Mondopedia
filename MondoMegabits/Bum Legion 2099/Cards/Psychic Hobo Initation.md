"Welcome to Psycho Psychic Schizo Psychosis; real life wallhacks- talking to birds, crazy next level shit like that. That's the type of shit I like." 

A bum initiate is dragged by his remaining hair through 9 inches of patty-caked shit, all the way down the drainpipe into CITY POOP CISTERN B-- a hobo-cult hangout F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.Â³ hasn't bothered raiding yet (it smells bad!). 
Step one commences-- the grunts pass by him in a line, smashing piss filled 40s into the initiate's buckled up skull. 
Head trauma is needed for the next part. Inhalants. Poop jenkem. Meth^2. Fart spray. Cocie-Colie (WORLD BEST SODA (PSYCHOACTIVE MDT-3 ACTIVATED (CHARCOAL + PSILOSYBIN EXTRACT))). The cult surrounds his convulsing cadavers, he JOLTS awake. Negalt, the leader of the Psychics, kneels. "You seein' it man?"
