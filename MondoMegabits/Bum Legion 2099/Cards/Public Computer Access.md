### "Just like lockable restrooms, the library is a Bum Army safehouse. The reason why libraries now only stock magazines (not the gun kind, thank Gosh!) and video games." 

Down the row, there are homeless people using every computer in the public library, looking up “how to get rich,” porn, “free money hacks,” Lotto ticket results. Homeless guys playing games, committing unemployment fraud, falling hard for catfishing. But, as you continue down the line, something catches your eye - one of the bums is looking at a straight HTML web 2.0 site. You watch his screen long enough to read and partially memorize a brief list of instructions ... he minimizes it and turns around to glare at you. You nod; you're all set.

2 INT to any creature. If you're brave enough to travel to the nearest public library and ask for "Remi-Anne" at the front desk, you may also draw any Gun card from your deck
