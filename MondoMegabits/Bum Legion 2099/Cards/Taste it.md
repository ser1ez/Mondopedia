# "Watch this!" 
A courageous act of self mutilation inspired by Sun Tzu's writings, 'Taste It' is simple: approach someone who needs a hand, perhaps someone working under a car. 
A hobbyist assembling a RC airplane, find any reason to pull out a multitool and offer a hand. 
Once the target is saying the expected 'No thanks, friend- I got it under contr-' stab a kniiufe through the underside of your chin, cutting straight through your tongue. Lock eyes with victim and mutter 'Look what you did to me!'. Try and get a ftew more stabs in before losing consciousness, take adva/ntage of their shocked state and fling some tongue blood onto their face or in their agasp mouth. Ruined. Forever. Your last words: 'Taste it. It tastes like metal.. is it the tool or.. the blood?" 

-------------------------- 

**Sacrifice, Taste It:** Sacrifice a creature, pick one target card to scar. Once scarred, target will deal 'emotional baggage' damage (50 DMG) to all friendly cards for 2 turns. 
On the third turn, target creature commits suicide after leaving a long note about how he can't stop seeing that split tongue, the look on your face when you shoved the blade deep inside. 
How he stopped going to work and stopped thinking about anything but dying and seeing you in hell. Sad
