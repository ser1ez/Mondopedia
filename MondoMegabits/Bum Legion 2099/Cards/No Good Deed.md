"Offer something tantalizing, like a crisp twenty dollar bill, or your girlfriend for the night." 
Fade into a car stuck in traffic. A bum sidles up and knocks on the driver’s window. 
The driver refuses in a muffled voice and shakes his head, a minute passes as talk radio plays. 
The bum comes back with a 20 dollar bill, pointing at the driver, implying it’s for him. 
"I'll bite. I guess." 
The driver opens the window, then the bum ducks out of the frame, pops back up and throws a wasp’s nest into the car. In the car, wasps begin to disperse and attack the driver. Inexplicably, the window goes up and the doors lock. 
The driver is screaming now; he tries the handle but it just breaks off. We see the car from half mile down the road, rocking back and forth with hazard lights on, and hear distant screams of agony. The bum glides past, feet hovering just above the ground, going at least 25 mph.
