In 2099, a once unified and organized PMC of low caste bums and hobos occupy the 2MASX supership. Tied to a common daydream of revolution, they stand as a Bum Army. The generals modeled their force's structure from that of western military forces pre-space launch, while incorporating all the benefits of the western force's enemies- the guerilla tactics that left infinitely funded war machines scratching their gray haired thinktankers' heads. 

As time dragged, the morale and might have arguably withered. The average Bum Army conscript is still a homeless drug addict after all- how functional could they ever be? Their ops consist of flooding sectors of the supership with feces, and less impressively, stealing cartons of space-grown tobacco sticks. Some argue they don't stand a chance in the face of space-age oppression, the punishment of vacuum launching ever looming- but note this: **Dumbass idiots get it done**. They're simply too high on shit fumes to admit defeat. 
You can't scare stupid. 

----------------- 
**Bum Army Anthem:** Unified in their valorant singsong (and windshield wiper vodka cocktails), the rank and file shake and smile! Morale boost. 
♦ +100 HP to all Bum Legion 2099 creatures currently in play. 

**History:** Surviving bums pass the torch. 
♦ So long as one (1) Bum Legion 2099 creature that was present for the anthem is still alive, all Bum Army creatures still get a +50 HP health buff
