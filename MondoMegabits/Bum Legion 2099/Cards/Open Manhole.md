"I'd rather smell like fermented shit and piss than take 450 DMG." Classic escape tactic used by Bum Legion 2099 game theorists and war planners. That smell though, like chicken soup... 

---------------------------- 

Fecal Egress: Use Open Manhole to dodge any one attack. 
♦ Bum Legion 2099 creatures heal 25 HP from the soothing fecal salve. 
♦ Bum Legion 2099 creatures have a chance of discovering something useful in the muck. Roll 15 or higher on a d20 and search your deck for one (1) item card to add to your hand. 
♦ All other creatures take 25 damage. "The dookie, it burns!" 
♦ Team PinkBean cannot use this tactic because they're scared of a little doo, pussies. We live for this shit
