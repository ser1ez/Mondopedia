### "My goodness and my fortress... my high tower and my Deliverer." 

Bum Legion operatives value an inconspicuous appearance of harmlessness. While the mass of the force's infantry relies on tattered britches and shit stained burlap armor, recon divisions need attire that makes them scientifically invisible. 

A Wet Garbage Ghillie Suit is just that, fastened upon it are empty lactose canisters, sticks of gum, wet flat soda, yellowed paper towels, even poopie diapers. 
Bum Legion Battle Geniuses know that effective visual camouflage isn't enough for perfect stealth- one must also master the art of scentblending. 
That's where the 'wet' in Wet Garbage Ghillie Suit comes in. Users often dip themselves in a dank molasses of the city's sweltered drainage to further their stealthy disguise. 

-----------------------
