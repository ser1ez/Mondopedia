"He who has the least to lose has the most to fight for" Phonebook Armor is a common sight among Bum Legion conscripts, often composed of 600 page classifieds- plenty enough paper to stop low caliber bullets. Weak to fire DMG.

Made it to Page 486: Would you look at that?! 
♦ Take no DMG from firearms. Can deflect 3 ballistic attacks before falling apart. 
♦ Concurrent fire DMG lasts twice as long while you have Phonebook Armor equipped
