# "It just feels perfect." 
♦ Street Price: One handjob (Subject to change) 
♦ Rush: Intense/Rollercoaster 
♦ Birthplace: Slab City, California - Kruger Mills Construction Company Portable Restroom #7, 1987 
♦ Street Names: Shitties, Shart Puff, Poopie Puffer, Shit Vape You've tried Whippets, and you've tried Jenkem, but Jenkem Whippets? 
Buckle up. 
Craftable from 1x Jenkem, 1x Whippet (Req: 1 Bum Type Creature in hand to craft).
The Jenkem Whippet first rose to prominence after a construction worker made the first prototype Jenkem Whippet in Slab City in the late 80s. 
Named the 'ShitWhippet MK I', the inventor soon traveled the country doing press runs, media interviews, and book deals for 3 solid years- carving an unpaved path for himself in the pharmaceutical startup industry. 
At one point its creator boasted 3 production facilities, 106 employees, and a large production deal with a high quality distributor overseas. Then he woke up in the port-a-potty. 

See how potent this shit is?
