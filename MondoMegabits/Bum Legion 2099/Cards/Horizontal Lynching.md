## "He's still kicking, keep driving." 

A common Bum Legion suicide strategy, Horizontal Lynching is a genius tactic devised by an unknown Bum Legion underling in the year 2079. 
Rumor has it the underling was suffering from extreme 'I Need A FentPerc But Can't Find One' syndrome and decided to go for a beautiful exit on a city park oak tree. When he jumped, the branch snapped. The Bum, with noose still attached to his neck, dusted himself off and courageously tied the rope to the tow hitch of a Ford 950-T that was stationary at a red light just feet away. 
The light went green and he went blue. There was a red streak for 4 miles. Then black.

**Sacrifice, Horizontal Lynching:** Pick a target card to sacrifice... His nobility and bravery in the face of overwhelming hell-life will embolden the pack for a decade to come. Everybody remembers scotty he was a good kid, beautiful, it was beautiful the way he plucked his banjo. Now heâ€™s dead. And you expect us to yield?! You expect us to have mercy???? 

+200 HP & +2 FYT for all creatures of the same faction that are currently in play at the time of the gruesome suicide
