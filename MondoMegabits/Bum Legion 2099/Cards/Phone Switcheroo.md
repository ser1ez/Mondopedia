# "BlackBerryBold." 

Epic Tier Sui-Strategy, Microstrategy. The 'Phone Switcheroo' is a clever and ingenious way to scar the enemy for life. The tactic is simple: Engage in conversation with target group. 
Get 5 minutes in, evoke empathy and be a likable guy that the group thinks is neat and interesting. 
Then, say you're getting a call. Suddenly reach in your pocket for your phone but instead pull out a snub nosed .357 revolver and stick it deep in your mouth, making sure to make eye contact with all people in the crowd before **BLOWING YOUR BRAINS OUT! **

--------------------- 
**Sacrifice, Phone Switcheroo:** Sacrifice a creature via fatal gunshot. Scar all all opponent creatures, giving them a sight they can't unsee. All enemy creatures deal half DMG for 2 turns
