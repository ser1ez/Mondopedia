"You know what me n' deez dogs been troo?? Evah since I been on da streets, we done did errtang togetha; we cwied tugetta, fought tugetta, fukt tugetta...we eben shot up tugetta! They'll kill fuh me or die tryin'!" 

Sicc'em, pups! King of Dogs loves puppies, hates people! People always fuck him over! Dogs never fuck him over! A dog has NEVER stolen a carton of humid cigs from King! King has never had a good friend in this cruel world! King is only friends with creatures that can't reason or critically think! King used to work a tech job in the early 2030's- ancient history. He tells himself if he ever wanted to go back in the fold he could easily get a job programming neural networks like he did at RayGeon (fat chance, it's 2099). 
He's from a bygone era. He has Dyna-AIDS. He's featured in several viral Chim-Toks- licking the grut out of his pup's teeth for extra calories. He's the pack leader- still. Everyone is the king of something.
