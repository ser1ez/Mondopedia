How to play

In order to play Mondo Megabits, you will need the following:

-   A deck of about 40 or so cards. There is no upper limit to the number of cards one's deck may contain, however, you may not have more than three copies of a single card in your deck.
-   Some dice or another way of generating random numbers.
-   Tokens to keep track of damage, funding, etc.
-   Substances to casually abuse.
-   A lack of conscience, shame, or any other quality that would imply retention of a human nature, especially the desire to blame this game's creators for any trouble players may cause or get themselves into.

Please watch the training video. At the beginning of the game, each player may look at the first 12 cards in their deck and play whatever they wish and have funding for. Any unplayed cards from this look are sent to the discard pile. Play order is determined by a bare-knuckle fight. Whoever wins the fist fight may play their cards first.

After the first two turns, normal gameplay commences. Four funding is added to each player's funding at the beginning of each turn and the active player may look at the next three cards in their deck and do what they wish accordingly. Then they may play whichever cards are active according to the rules. When they have run out of possible actions or wish to end their turn, they do so and pass active play status to the opponent.

The ultimate arbiter of Mondo rules is pure schizophrenic force of will: complaining, gang stalking, dementia, gaslighting, love bombing. Any rule can be bent, even broken, if you make a big enough scene or cause enough problems for enough people. The degree to which you express your autism in, say, a high-stakes Mondo Megabits tournament will ultimately decide the degree to which you are victorious.

We here at Mondo Megabits wish you the best of luck, the most of fun, the greatest of thrills, and the least of worries. May your play be good. Goodbye.

# The Keys to the Kingdom

The ultimate aim of a game of Mondo Megabits is to control the narrative. The narrative is represented by three cards that sit closest to the player and have a counter that represents their current level of acceptance among the masses. The scale ranges from negative five to positive five, with zero being the middle ground.

## Forming Your Narrative

To form your narrative, you need to combine an agenda, a subtype, a figurehead, and an incantation. These cards sit closest to the player and remain on the board throughout play. Their effects can be triggered at any time, including to interrupt enemy play. After triggered, they are tapped but not discarded. Unlike the regular cards in the player's hand, they do not untap at the beginning of the next turn. Instead, they must be funded to untap (more on this later).

The three cards that make up your narrative collectively start with a single counter at zero. This zero represents their current state of acceptance among the masses.

-   Negative five: Your narrative is a conspiracy theory. You lose.
-   Negative four: Rogan.
-   Negative three: Highly unlikely but still believed by antisocial types.
-   Negative two: Sounds fishy, think Princess Diana.
-   Negative one: Hmm, now it's zero. That's the baseline, your hypothetically possible proposal TED Talk level.
-   Positive one: Gaining traction with "academics."
-   Positive two: Science-backed.
-   Positive three: Taught to kindergarteners.
-   Positive four: Your narrative must be believed to hold a job or rent an apartment/car.
-   Positive five: Your narrative is a fundamental underlying truth which cannot be escaped or questioned. You win.

## Discrediting Your Opponent's Narrative

To attack your opponent's narrative, you must first wipe out all the creatures in their hand and trigger their buffer zone (more on this later). You cannot discredit your opponent's narrative on the same turn that their buffer zone has been triggered. After this has been done, you must still have at least one untapped creature in your hand to do the attacking. Regardless of this creature's attack abilities, special equipment, etc., your attack may only damage your opponent's narrative by one point in a given turn. Even if you have five creatures ready to attack, it is still one point per turn.

The one exception to all the above is cards of the type "Plot Twist." Most plot twists don't do narrative damage, but those that do may be used at any point on their own or in conjunction with a regular attack, etc.

## Empowering Your Narrative

To empower your own narrative by one point, you must spend 10 funding points at once. Certain plot twists and other cards may empower your narrative as well. These may be used at any time.

## Intersectionality

Intersectionality, also known as mixing factions, allows players to mix factions and use different cards to empower their own narrative. As a puppet master, you are not locked in specifically to the use of one faction's cards.
Many cards have intra-faction synergies
They will say so, however, you are an ideological chameleon and an unabashed pragmatist. As a matter of fact, for most factions, it is impossible to play using only cards from that faction. Diversity is actually a prerequisite, though labor representation, fair wages are not. For you, it is simple child's play to take an agenda from the techno-oppressive FEMA cube and set to work upon it lackeys from bum army 2099, psychos, and ditch diggers. It's as easy as one, two, three to take rainbow rioters, team pink bean lesbians, and naval gazing intelligentsia and get them working together to support a jack-booted cop-sucking figurehead from the thin blue wine. Manipulating creatures to act not only in your will but against their own is such an easy feat that it is taken for granted as a core game mechanic and costs nothing, not even a moment of attention. Behind the scenes, of course, there's a great deal of engineering, multiple layers of blackmail, and ultrasonic 5g programming to get the neon to play nice with the black Hebrew Israelites. Thankfully, this is done on behalf of the player by the game designers, just another way Mondo Megabits rewards you.

## Funding

### Funding

Nothing is free, not even for the frugal survival rats of bum army 2099. Bringing any card into your hand requires funding equal to two points plus half that card's rarity level rounded down. R1 cards cost two points, R2 and R3 cards cost three points, R4 and R5 cost four points, and R6 cards cost five points of funding. Both players start with the maximum amount of 20 funding, thanks to a generous grant from George Soros and the Sackler family. Funding is restored every turn at a rate of four funding per turn. Certain tactics may increase a player's funding but never above the maximum. Maximum funding implies the player is able to print fake money at a rate which supersedes all the world's wealth and thus it is impossible to exceed maximum funding without breaking the laws of physics.

## The Deck, The Hand, The Discard Pile

### The Deck, The Hand, The Discard Pile

The deck, the hand, and discard pile all function as one would expect from a card game. At the beginning of every turn, the player may look at the top three cards in his deck. He may play whichever of these cards he can afford to, discard whichever he likes, or place them all back on top of the deck if he wishes. Cards are played with funding. After a card has been exhausted (more on this later), it is sent to the discard pile. Once all cards in the deck have been played or discarded, the player takes the discard pile, shuffles it, and it becomes his deck again.

## The Board

### The Board

The board refers to the actual surface where cards are played, whether it be a table, a cardboard box, or a dirty needle-covered floor. The board is divided into three zones:

1. The Think Tank: This is where your narrative goes, closest to the puppet master (that's you).
2. The Buffer Zone: The player may place face-down up to one tactic, one creature card of patsy, double agent, or bad actor subtypes only, and one challenge card in between his think tank and the opponent as a stop-gap emergency measure. These cards are not played in normal play; instead, they are triggered one time only and all at once should your opponent breach your front lines and threaten to attack your narrative. Regardless of what

## Factions

-   Factions more or less represent the ideological stripe and aesthetic presentation of all cards which fall under their domain.
-   Certain cards of the same faction when played together will have synergistic benefits, it will say so on the cards, especially when paired with the faction's faction card (that's the one describing the faction).
-   However, in mondo just as in real life, most allegiances and distinctions will dissolve into muck with the right mix of well-timed lies and injections of non-profit liquid capital.
-   Synergies can be powerful, but players should not feel restricted from mixing cards from seemingly disparate factions.
-   It is the puppet master's job to ensure that all parties ultimately serve power.

## Card Types and Subtypes

# [[Creatures]]

-   All regimes ultimately need armies to enforce their insane whims, your creatures are that army.
-   Creatures may not act during the same turn they are played, this is known as summoning sickness (a term that we invented).
-   A creature may either do a basic attack or an ability, but not both every turn.
-   Creatures with five or higher fighting ability may perform two attacks per turn.
-   Creatures with ten fighting ability may perform three attacks.
-   Creatures with five or higher energy projection may perform two abilities per turn.
-   Creatures with ten NRG may perform three abilities per turn.
-   Creatures with five or higher swag may perform both basic attacks and abilities in the same turn, and may perform as many as their respective FYT and NRG ratings will allow.
-   A basic attack does damage to a single target in the amount of 100 times the attacking creature's STR or strength rating.
-   Abilities do different things on a case-by-case basis, they are written at the bottom of the card.
-   Creatures remain in play until they are destroyed.

# [[Items]]

-   Items cost two funding points to play, regardless of rarity.
-   Items do various things and have various effects, usually buffing one or another stat or giving its owner some new ability.
-   They must be attached to a creature in order to function, when the holding creature is destroyed, the item may be passed on to another creature.
-   If all creatures are destroyed, return all in play items to your discard pile.
-   The number of items that a creature may hold is, like in real life, based on its swag or SWG stat.
-   One/two/three SWAG, one item limit; three to six SWAG, two items; six to nine SWAG, three items; and if your creature's got 10 SWAG, he can have as many items as he wants.

# [[Tactics]] 
Tactics cost two funding points to play, regardless of their rarity. They are one-time use cards that do something such as starting a fire, stealing a wallet, or making people come, etc. Most tactics will have multiple effects listed at the bottom of the card, and all these effects must be enacted simultaneously. The player cannot choose to skip effects that do not benefit them. Sometimes, these effects will be a case of either-or, where one gets enacted and the other ignored. If this is the case, it will say so on the card explicitly. Tactics enter into play when they are funded but don't take effect until their owner declares them to be so. This may be done at any time. They are discarded immediately thereafter.

# [[Agendas]]
Agendas are powerful, and it is recommended that they be dealt with expediently. An opponent's agenda can be dismantled by any single attack. However, an agenda cannot be attacked while your opponent still has creatures in play unless you attack the agenda with a card that explicitly states you may do so while enemy creatures are alive, you attack the agenda with a creature whose intelligence is eight or higher, or you attack the agenda with a creature of one of the following subtypes: figurehead, revolutionary, bad actor, double agent. Dismantling an opponent's agenda card will discredit their narrative by one point. If you have already funded and played an agenda card but wish to swap it out with another, you may do so one time.

# [[Plot Twists]]
Plot twists change the game and radically shift the paradigm. They can be enacted at any point in play, and their effects are wide-reaching and powerful, with each card doing something different. After a player plays a plot twist, all effects from tactics and agendas are halted for one full turn. This applies to both players. Plot twists are discarded after use.

# [[Locations]] 
Locations are persistent cards that dictate the environment of play and have effects that usually apply to both players. They may be played without providing funding. Only one location may be played at a time, and the card is set to the side and turned so that both players may see it. The location is removed and returned to its owner's discard pile only when either player plays a new location card. For example, a player might play a location which is a planet with very high gravity, making it impossible for creatures with strength lower than 5 to perform basic attacks. This debuff would apply to both players. If the opponent had no creature cards with strength higher than five, you would not be able to do any basic attacks until playing new creatures or playing a new location.

# [[Challenges]]

Challenges are sets of conditions which, when met, provide some sort of buff or bonus to the persons meeting them. They may be played without providing any funding. This is known as a free contest. Like locations, challenges are placed to the side and turns so that both players may see. Once a challenge has been completed by a player, the other player has one turn to try to complete it themselves before it is removed from play and placed back in its owner's discard pile.

# [[Buffs and Debuffs]]

Buffs and debuffs may be played for one funding point. They are similar to items in that they must be applied to a creature and their effects persist until that creature is destroyed. They may be applied to a creature of your own or to an opponent's creature. Once applied, they can't be removed; you just gotta live with them. Like AIDS, like HIV, much like monkey pox, the proper way to think of this is the same way you think about monkey pox.

# [[Groups]]

Group cards cost three funding points to play and provide persistent benefits to all friendly creatures until they're removed. To remove an opponent's group card only requires one attack of any type. However, a group card cannot be attacked while any creatures of the same faction are in play. Group cards sometimes have abilities. If there are multiple abilities listed, only one may be used per turn. Once a group's ability has been used, it cannot be used a second time.

# [[Skills]]

Skills cost one funding point to play. They're similar to items but they are destroyed when the creature they are attached to is destroyed.

# [[Incantations]]

Incantations invoke the dark side of mondo megabits. You might want to think twice before adding these to your deck. They are like tactics but they cost zero funding points to play and they must be played immediately upon seeing them in the deck. The player may not choose to not play them.

# [[Information]]

Information is free and typically useless, but worth its weight in gold to someone like me. These cards sometimes have abilities and effects, but are mostly just there to provide a little spice, backstory to an otherwise boring and dry game. When a card effect conflicts with the core rules of the game, remember that cards always hold priority over the rules.
