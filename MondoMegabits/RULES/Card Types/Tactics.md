Tactics cost two funding points to play, regardless of their rarity. They are one-time use cards that do something such as starting a fire, stealing a wallet, or making people come, etc. Most tactics will have multiple effects listed at the bottom of the card, and all these effects must be enacted simultaneously. The player cannot choose to skip effects that do not benefit them. Sometimes, these effects will be a case of either-or, where one gets enacted and the other ignored. If this is the case, it will say so on the card explicitly. Tactics enter into play when they are funded but don't take effect until their owner declares them to be so. This may be done at any time. They are discarded immediately thereafter.
