Agendas are powerful, and it is recommended that they be dealt with expediently. An opponent's agenda can be dismantled by any single attack. However, an agenda cannot be attacked while your opponent still has creatures in play unless you attack the agenda with a card that explicitly states you may do so while enemy creatures are alive, you attack the agenda with a creature whose intelligence is eight or higher, or you attack the agenda with a creature of one of the following subtypes: figurehead, revolutionary, bad actor, double agent. Dismantling an opponent's agenda card will discredit their narrative by one point. If you have already funded and played an agenda card but wish to swap it out with another, you may do so one time.
