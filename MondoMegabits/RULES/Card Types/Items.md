-   Items cost two funding points to play, regardless of rarity.
-   Items do various things and have various effects, usually buffing one or another stat or giving its owner some new ability.
-   They must be attached to a creature in order to function, when the holding creature is destroyed, the item may be passed on to another creature.
-   If all creatures are destroyed, return all in play items to your discard pile.
-   The number of items that a creature may hold is, like in real life, based on its swag or SWG stat.
-   One/two/three SWAG, one item limit; three to six SWAG, two items; six to nine SWAG, three items; and if your creature's got 10 SWAG, he can have as many items as he wants.
