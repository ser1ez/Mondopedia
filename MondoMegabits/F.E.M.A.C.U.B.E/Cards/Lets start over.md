"I'm stuck in a loop where I'm perpetually telling our son that mom died, and then resetting it over and over again." 

Basically a do-over after you say the wrong thing. Think of it as a quick-save before you do something funny in Oblivion - except in real life. In the 5th Dimension there are no mistakes - only re-do's.
