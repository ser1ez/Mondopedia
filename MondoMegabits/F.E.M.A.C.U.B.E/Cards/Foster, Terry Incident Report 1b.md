“Part 2 of a multi-page incident report detailing the activities of an individual sheeple named FOSTER, TERRY. Data collected by CIA 3 (Dark Green). Do not redistribute.” 

Incident Report 1b At 1120 HOURS, subject FOSTER, TERRY was captured on security camera 96-b - - DUNKIN' COFFEE on 50 CLINTON ST, ROCHESTER, NY 14620 SIDE PARKING LOT OVERHEAD ANGLE #4 STEREOSCOPIC (Audio Disabled). While the automated beverage delivery system prepared the standard coffee and opiate blend for FOSTER, TERRY, the robot barista’s “small talk” subroutine queried FOSTER, TERRY with the following: “Greetings flesh entity of indeterminate gender identity and sexual orientation! Isn’t it a great day to appreciate all the FedGov has done for us?” 

Instead of the correct answer (“SPORT BALL IS GOOD”) facial expression and tone analysis suggests FOSTER, TERRY made a FROWNY SAD FACE and declined to respond to “small talk” with the SmartBarista AI. As outlined in the CIA 3 (Dark Green) BEHAVIORAL MODEL GUIDEBOOK, withdrawing from daily “small-talk” conversations with software subroutines or fellow workers is often an early indicator of dangerous antisocial behavior patterns. Seeing this, Agent REDACTED deemed it critical that FOSTER, TERRY be constantly bombarded with therapeutic socialization to halt the gestation of said antisocial behavior patterns. FRIEND 1 and FRIEND 2 then repeatedly called FOSTER, TERRY over and over again for hours, and left a combined 214 voicemails featuring a variety of FedGov approved non-threatening sports/news/entertainment talking points.
