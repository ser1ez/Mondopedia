"Это начало новой эры." 

Location: Northern Russia. Initial Impact Crater Radius: 3.26 km A meteor impact site containing big fragments of kooky space stuff. 

CONTAINS: 
- Space Potatoez 
- Moon Fossils 
- ‘Neil Armstronk’: 
a new type of Space Weed grown exclusively on Nebular Reticulum Colony 3c-i, apparently physics is different in that region (due to Black Lives Matter Supermass 3c-i) so the THC molecule skips a link and literally isn't THC, it's actually THB (technically making it 'not weed' but physically looks just like weed- other than the purple metallic leaf texture & alien smell. Smells loud but also a little like gasoline, fitting because one time I rolled it in a blunt with my homie Andre that lives next to me in Apt 3C (coincidence???) 'This shit's gasoline' word for word is what he said I swear to God. Unfortunately he got mad fucked up and 'Little Greened Out, Man' (funny little play on words I thought up to describe when someone smokes alien dope and greens out, trust me not the first time. It's understandable: He literaly had never smocked alien weed before so he basically had no T (Tolerance) LOL. 4 Lightyear T-break. Lol.
