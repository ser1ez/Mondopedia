"We are currently at a Code Blue. You better hope to God we don't see a Code Magenta." [Play this card face-down until the rules say to reveal it.] Beginning in 2020 after the rise of Rainbow R!ot, FedGov had to develop their own threat advance warning system to combat the Gay Agenda. The system carefully monitors AIDS outbreaks and attempts to associate them with the corresponding Grindr accounts, in order to pin down culprits before they can strike again. F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ agents assigned to this task force are thoroughly vetted for homosexuality, and forced at gunpoint to take the Heterosexual Pledge. 

-------------------- 

Condemnation: Pause the game to accuse the other player of being gay in real life- act legitimately suspicious. Use any of their past actions which may cast doubt on their character as evidence. Make it as convincing as possible and demand they confess. Do not prematurely reveal that these accusations stem from the usage of this card or you lose the game. Once opponent is sufficiently stressed out, reveal this card. All enemy Rainbow R!ot cards take 250 PSI damage from having their covers blown. This ability may be used more than one time per game. 

Hetero Iron Dome: Whenever the opponent wishes to play a Rainbow R!ot card, they must show you the card first and wait one (1) additional turn before playing it. This gives you time to prepare your sexuality for the inevitable full-frontal assault. 

Roundup: Send in an army of IRS agents to make sting operations at gloryholes across the country. Two (2) enemy Rainbow R!ot cards are arrested and unable to act for two (2) turns. This ability may only be used one (1) time per game, as once the trap is sprung, the Gay Agenda will finally learn to encrypt their dick pics. Additionally, tease and tickle your opponent’s thing under the table until he pulls it out (pretend you don’t know what’s going on), then when he does, aggressively grab it and try to smash/fuck up his nuts hospital-style while grinning at him like the Joker
