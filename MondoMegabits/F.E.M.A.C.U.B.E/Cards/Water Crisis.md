### "Water is so boring I start thinking about tits as soon as you talk about it." 

F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ Space Amusements Ltd. new directive: scout sector B-9POX-a Quadrozed for asteroid of suitable size/quality to host the biggest and best ever zero-G funpark for Grand Hullyunghan Gyosujin (FedGov Grand Senior Military Staff). 

Cover story to explain massive spending: Water Crisis. Must find ice-rich asteroid by 2150 or everyone on Earth dies of thirst! (This of course will be sometime after all the ice caps melt from gas-guzzling muscle cars driving too fast!) Just because the Water Crisis is engineered and totally unnecessary doesn’t make it any less real. 

Be careful when discussing this sci-fi concept not to inadvertently upset the people who are doing it for real. …Water tastes gross anyways.
