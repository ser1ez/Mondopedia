## "Now everything's legal, everything's permitted." 

Gas Station Adrenochrome is so fucking stronkkk. You've tried the other ones- Pharmacell Innetech AdrenoSerum, Dog Blood, Baby Blood (Straight from source). It doesn't hit the same.. Something about the gas station, specifically this exact gas station (Khout across from the Veteran’s Healthcare Administration building three blocks down Atwells from the homeless shelter, maybe that’s why they have such good shiiit).. Rush unlike any other. Probably cut it with CBD honey straws, the stuff they have on the counter right next to it. Fire. The shit Raul Duke dreams about.

I Am Become Vampyr: You dose. 
♦ 2X DMG for next attack 
♦ Drawback: You are now Vampyr. The night beckons, you wane as the moon does. For the first time ever you can understand the chatter of the bats at nyght. You resp'nd. An unholy union forms, the thyrst grows evermore as your former self turns weary. Dread incarnyte, you doth know the eve at which you Feast draws near. When the fang doth sink, there is no turnyng back. You become the nyght. You own the dark'ness.
