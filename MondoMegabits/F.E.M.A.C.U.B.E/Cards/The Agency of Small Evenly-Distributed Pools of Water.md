"Love, whether it's friendship or more, is like a cup. It fills up drop by drop, until one last drop and the cup is full. The liquid hangs there almost above the rim, hangs there on surface tension alone and you know that one more drop and it will spill over." - Laurell K. Hamilton

♦ Hey, you should shuffle your deck, then: 
♦ Take all of your creature cards, and sort by FYT.

♦ Hey, actually let's sort by SWG. 
♦ Reshuffle deck.
