"Death is just the beginning... of their usefulness to us."
Leopold von Schrenckm 

You can revive people who would normally be non-clonable and permadead. At least half of the subject’s brain must be intact for this ability to work. Once you’ve collected enough corpse fragments, coat them with biostasis spray* to prevent further decomposition and the extraction team will dump the guts into the next available cloner. With enough spray, biostasis can last an indefinite period of time, so basically you can keep allies' brains in your inventory and do this when you get around to it.
