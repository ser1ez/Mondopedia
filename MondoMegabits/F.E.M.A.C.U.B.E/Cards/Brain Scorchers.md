### "Bhunk-Tuu! Rasmah'Ta Aang... Gow!" 

The Brain Scorchers have inherited the world. They puzzle over the now defunct ruins. 

While these tribals don’t understand the dormant obelisks which litter the horizon and seem poised to puncture the sky itself, they do at least recognize the powerful phallic shape, and have a custom of mutilating themselves to better mimic the imposing spires. 

heir culture is rich with storytelling. The Brain Scorchers have a long running verbal fanfiction. This lore is passed down from the elders, generation to generation. Mother bite chunk of their son's ______ and he _________ pain while _____ stomps bloody ______ and great cloud god say if firstborn dares to ________ before he _______, then lightning and tornado and hyena will ______ the whole family for one hundred sun years. 

They are not intelligent enough to be aware of their buffs and debuffs. For example, agrarian Brain Scorchers occupy the Lein-Tkuu Basin, the continent’s most fertile region. They believe this area to be blessed by CloudSkyGod translation incomplete, but its fertility is actually an effect of ancient photosynthesis acceleration modules, still active in the region after untold aeons. 

The ominous pylons so ubiquitous and so central to their religion are, in fact, Neuro Oppressors—towers which broadcast special beams that keep mammalian brains scattered and… scorched (IQ permanently capped at 50). Used several thousand years ago to quell rebellions by the Brain Scorchers’ subjugated ancestors, the Neuro Oppressors have outlived their purpose—the conquering aliens who installed them have long since moved on to other planets. 
Too bad they didn’t shut them off on their way out.
