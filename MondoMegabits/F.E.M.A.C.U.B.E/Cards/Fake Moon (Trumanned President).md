"Rolling? How's my hair? This doesn't make sense, isn't there supposed to be no gravity here?.. How's my hair?" 

Trip to the Moon (2099) is an anthology picture being directed by several prominent directors of the 60s, all resurrected via FAKE TECH cloning GIZMOS for their one final flick: John Sturges does the takeoff, Roman Polanski does the ship part, John Ford does the actual lunar module/rock collection, etc. Stanley Kubrick does act III but he's also the main director, the only one who's in on the whole scam(the lesser directors think they’re filming a Netflix original). 
There’s lots of arguments on-set about how the moon’s technically supposed to be really hot- 
“We have to cut any water-based plot points!” 
The President gives notes: he wants more coverage of the US military, mentions of the nuclear arsenal, maybe a love interest for Neil Armstrong? In the cutting room, Kubrick looks at the choppy shitty space footage, flag waving in the wind. “Goddammit..” he mutters. “..We’re going to have to really go to the moon after all.”
