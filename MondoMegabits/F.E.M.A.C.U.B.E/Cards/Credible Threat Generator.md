## "Don't click the link." 

Used primarily by CIA 1-5 phaze-spooks to generate emails and message board posts which provide probable cause for search and seizure warrants, as well as backstory for false flag shootings. Among other things, this bot will redirect every web address to www.myfreechildporn.honeypot.fbi.gov while emailing every New York Times reporter with fantastical death threats (from your account). 

“IT’S ONLY A 20 MINUTE DRIVE TO UR FAMILY HOME WHEN I GET THERE WE PLAY THE REVOLVER GAME BUT I WIN” This clever little piece of malware will also create an encrypted VPN tunnel into your mom's brain so she will tell every news outlet how disturbed and depraved you were as a child. She will get away scot-free despite having and kept you unnecessarily on lithium and a bunch of other meds for a decade (so that you’d shut the hell up). 

------------------- 

Treat Detected: When this card is played, the opponent is forced to say a specific, credible threat out loud while holding their cell phone or Alexa device up to their mouth. Make sure they speak as clearly as possible and give their full name, address, and date/time. They must also say "This is not a joke. In the event that this recording is played in court, I must emphasize that I am serious and not joking about my intent to commit acts of violence." 

Public Interest: Turn after threat is verbalized, your Thin Blue Whine/F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ creature may attack twice in one turn
