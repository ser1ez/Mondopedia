"Look sonny- it's a good gig. Do your piece, 20 years go by quick. Retired at 26? I'd kill to be in your shoes kid." 

The CIA (F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ SUBSIDIARY) easily pours ~1 million SOCIAL CREDITS into a level 3 disguise (fake nose, fake eyes, fake ebony skin grafts)- Level 4 disguises transforme one fully anew. Race reversal, limb shrinking & age regression- all costly. The obvious TaxGov savings solution was to move to level 5: stop transforming 30 year old white guys into children and black dudes- and just hire children and black dudes. The taxpayer's savings were funneled into Iraqi missiles. 

CIA Child Soldier loves Fortnite, soccer, and he LOVES mommy (Mommy is a FedGov actor). Mommy's primary goal is to place her little hero in the field to collect data. CIA Child Soldier is trained to tattle on state enemies.
