"Suspect begging for mercy; requesting permission to urinate all over him while he cries" 

IRS Stormtrooper has the best of both worlds: the gear/training/bladder of a US Army troopherokiller, with the local clout and sashay of a insert area code cophero. 
IRS Stormtroopers act as the enforcement arm of F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³’s personal financial reporting authority. They decided to go for a more ‘technofuturistic loan shark’ approach when dealing with debtors after the mid 21st, after realizing burnt car chassis and familythreat are statistically more effective that form letters and bank account levies. Loved for all for how fair and easy they make life. And average citizen with nothing to hide has nothing to fear- that is unless they forgot to file in 2059, the same year they got hired to paint that house for $2500. Knock knock.
