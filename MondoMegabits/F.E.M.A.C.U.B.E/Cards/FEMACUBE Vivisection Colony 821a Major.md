Wow! I'm so glad I was chosen as one of the human elite- the first to ever establish a space colony! I was afraid my obesity and low IQ would hold me back, but I guess anything is possible- especially with F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³'s help! :) " 

Space colony on an artificial planet orbiting a ‘mini’ black hole. (roughly 3.5 solar masses). There's no sunlight, but that doesn't bother me! I'm totally content to play OverWar Twinks 3D (a popular game for retarded children) with my friends, while waiting for my organs to be harvested. In OverWar Twinks 3D I play a kitsune-chan (sexy fox) mage/gunwizard- basically DPS with a touch of magical buffing and high dodge. What? No, I'm not worried about the organ thing. They cut into the healthy people first, so long as I keep playing OverWar Twinks 3D and rotting in my useless body, 

I’m safe. PS: Also if any of my Colony 821a Major ex-friends are reading this (Kitthu, MarJoni, Coopl0x.. Yeah Coopl0x- you too). F** you. I know you guys said I manipulated Bruto but the funny thing is: Bruto is bi, and he was feeling rather hetero the night we hung out and didn't let me do anything sexual except rub our tails together. We stayed up all night in my PodX® watching NebulaSims, it was incredibly beautiful >.< Keep talking shit about me, u guys literally still play Little Big Bimbo Planet and are just mad I don't wanna watch Flying Spaghetti Monster Westerns with you on Rabb.it. I’m over ur little space opera drama club BS, I have new friends now. SUCK IT 

--------------------------

Fun Colony 821a Major Facts #1: Colony 821a Major has a surface gravity of 400, conveniently pinning you to your gaming chair/operating table and removing the need for cumbersome uncomfortable restraints. This allows F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ robotic organ-retrieval specialists to work efficiently and without the use of expensive anesthetics (I heard one chew of NeuroToxy™ Bubble-Jum is over 45,000 space dollars. Worst part: they don’t even let you blow bubbles unless you’re on MinervaCare). 

♦ Non-F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ creatures with a STR of 5 or lower are immobilized and cannot attack (may still use non-physical abilities). Fun Colony 821a Major Facts #2: Colony 821a Major performs more than six million vivisections a year! All robotic organ-retrieval specialists employed by the colony have cybernetic brains… cybernetic, powerful, Woman of Color brains. Thanks to FedGov™’s new POCks ‘n’ WOCks in Space initiative, these organs will save Black Lives & Black Bodies all over the galaxy! 

♦ Sacrifice a creature to vivisect it. A friendly F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ creature may absorb its stats and HP
