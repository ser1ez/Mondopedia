"POTUS 68 rev. 1.3" There is a 1:1 model of Washington DC ("Nega-DC") in a central Nevada salt flat- the President of the United States of America lives and works there. He is doing an amazing job of running the nation and playing hardball with foreign heads of state, it's hard work. 

A down-to-earth guy despite being the most powerful man in the world, Mr. President hands out handmade pickled onions at the ‘Washington D.C.’ County Fair. He spends a lot of energy on making the perfect pickled onion, but he’s got time to take photos with constituents and answer tough Q’s from John and Jane Voter. We;ve got to be tough on crime, but it’s a balancing act, like getting the right mix of vinegar, salt, spices and Papa President’s Mystery Pickled Onion Flavor-Booster (molasses). Today is the big day. Blue Room pow-wow on Big Tech. Conference call with REDACTED re: stealth drone acquisition numbers. Televised statement on the New Olympus Mons hostilities. Good Afternoon NAMERAC live pickled onion demonstration. Theres one (1) problem: Everybody that the president interacts with today- and every day- is either a paid actor, a CIA handler, or a member of Nega DC’s fifty-thousand-member lighting and camera crew department. 
Generally, the aptly-named Secrets Service is able to shield against infohazards, but a complex system like this is bound to encounter failure. Eventually, The President is gifted a piece of contraband- a set of binoculars- from a visiting child. With them he realizes that his view of Washington Cathedral, which gave him strength in many a difficult time, is just a matte painting. Now that the viel is lifted, he walks forlorn out of the Nega White House, toward the horizon for miles and miles, until finally coming to a massive landfill, just outside of city limits. It’s full of his delicious homemade pickled onions. The President drops to his knees and weeps as a sniper’s red dot centers itself on his forehead- it’s all been a waste.
