"Yes, Pres-i-dent. 

We come to.. tell you-that- ex-tremism is on.. the riiise.” 

After being sworn in, the President has become the central figure in a large Truman Show scheme- where he thinks he is running the nation but in reality is trapped in a model Washington DC somewhere in Nevada. Stage trickery makes him believe he's attending N.A.T.O.³ conferences and giving speeches in real US cities, but it’s all fake.
To simulate crossing the ocean, they fly circles around Lake Mead for 30 minutes. He gives speeches to auditoriums filled with NDA’d craigslist actors and FedGov holograms. When drunk and vulnerable, his CIA bodyguards drug his chocolate-chocolate chip with MDT-3 Macro and stage fake alien abductions where he is taken into a disc-shaped spacecraft. Operatives donning Alibaba halloween alien suits ask pointed questions and disseminate hoax information about current bills awaiting approval.
Unsurprisingly, his FedGov™ handlers follow up daily alien news with harcore anal-probing, captured by 32k Japanese cameras. 
These kompromat UHD photos are filed for blackmail and political trolling in his senier years (if he behaves). To conclude the space hoax, they toss him down a flight of stairs every time. There is no reason for this, his F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ handlers just think it’s funny. Hoax integrity determined by F³ truthcheckers.
