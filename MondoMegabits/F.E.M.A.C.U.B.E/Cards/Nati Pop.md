----------------------- 

Grrrlboss Respect: Any time your opponent attacks one of your creatures, he must say forgive me, Queen". If he forgets to do this, the attack fails and the opponent’s creature takes 100 DMG. Place a Misogynist counter on the attacker, if male. 

Grrrlboss Appreciate: Your opponent must pay you ONE (1) per turn for every female creature you “control”, OR ONE (1) coin per turn for each male creature he controls, whichever is higher. Misogynists cost TWO 2 coins. 

Grrrlboss Protect: Your Intelligentsia creatures are invulnerable. 

Grrrlboss Empower: F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ and Rainbow R!ot creatures you control get +2 FYT, permanently (the state-run media apparatus defends everything they say and do, no matter how demonic)
