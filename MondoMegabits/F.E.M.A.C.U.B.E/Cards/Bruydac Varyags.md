OFFICIAL F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ WORDBRIEF MEMO#77189217 

The planet of Bruydac is ruled by three tribal clans possessing technology and tools roughly on par with early Terran Bronze Age civilizations. 

The most dangerous of these clans is the Varyags- an expansionist, warlike peoples originating in the arid deserts common to Bruydac’s northern hemisphere. They are characterized by extreme birthrate, extreme poverty, and extreme violence. Their law and government are only small facets of a broad collection of quasi-religious superstitions which to an outsider resemble random bloodshed. 

Their rulers- known as “Yags”- seldom last longer than a single Terran year before being killed by challengers or assassins. For this reason, negotiating with the Varyag will be difficult. It may prove easier to neutralize them via genomic weapon.
