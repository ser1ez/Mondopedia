"Hybrid Jewish-Mayan Zeptotronic Simulation." 

Height: 2004 
Weight: more than you can handle 
First Appearance: Leibniz's journals 
Overarching Goal: Assimilation 
Quote: (sweating really hard, concentrating, brow furrowed) "Inculcate coherence.... restore subjective unity required to structure tota ordinall information... render model useful and actionable by master system subroutines...." 

This is either a really cool computer network or a real big tuna net that catches lots of dolphins and seals every time you try to fish for tuna. You sell the dolphin meat for a lil extra dough. 

But, regarding the computer version: It's basically the Al Gore internet but the sequel. Same contestants, same undersea cables... but a whole new potpourri of whacked-out challenges. 

--------------- 

Reboot - - - Net-Wide Data Outage: Opponent must turn all cards facedown. Stats and abilities are scrambled but cards may still act (players take turns randomly guessing what they do) 

Adversary (User) Detected - - - Black I.C.E.: Check opponentâ€™s phone- if wifi or Bluetooth are enabled, electrocute his head. Detection is tantamount to death, Obsucrity is the security. Opponent must place phone in a lead and coloidal silver-lined security bag in order to have you remove taser from side of his head. If no such security bag is present, continue electrocution until tenn (10) game turns have been completed.
