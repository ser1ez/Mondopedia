"Artificial sun projecting fake daylight into my apartment creating fake shadows as the decoy cars are parked exactly where the FBI officials told them to… Of course… Currently sitting in my apartment waiting for the actors to disperse."  overheard on Schizotok 

Welcome to the "Good & Governments Gangstalking & Gaslighting Guys & Girls" (Targeted Individual Database) Program! 
The cops are your friends and they're all just watching you because they all think you are really cool and want to hang out with you. They sit in their cubicles watching your every move fantasizing about one day being best friends with you and they have framed photos of you on their nightstands that they kiss with lipstick every night. Every cop in the world has a personal shrine of thousands of zoomed in grainy traffic camera photos of your face, all connected with red string on an evidence board, the red string spelling out the sentence "My Secret Friend." You're on a list all right - a list labeled "Pretty Cool Guys".
