"Real Eyes Realize Real Lies." 

Everything you have ever witnessed in your life was a carefully orchestrated forgery. Your possessions are nearly all rental pieces from the prop department. The people you have met, even those you’ve known for years and hold closest to you, are actors on the payroll of the world’s largest comedy troupe (look for a flesh-tone earpiece). Even the thoughts in your head-while some may be organic-many are the product of ever-present pulses of binaural sound emanating from the “headache gun” mounted atop the Chevy Astro* parked outside your house this very moment (it’s not actually a pizza delivery sign-are you naive?) Those not in the know don’t see anything out of the ordinary, but those in the know, they can see it’s all Glow-in-the-Dark. 

Citizens (feeders AKA sheeple) are running in circles with daily distractions custom-tuned to maximally headzap them and keep them backflipping through the flaming rings of FedGov street theater. Restaurant owners often get fake delivery orders throughout the day, for food items that cannot and should not ever exist. Police get fake calls about domestic disputes at fast food parking lots, calls that lead them on a wild goose chase. calls that originate from a phone inside their own precinct- it doesn't make any sense. FedGov licensed carpenters drill holes in your house’s support beams and insert termite eggs (but why would they re-tile the entire bathroom in a nearly identical, but subtly different color? Was that the real spoof?) These special tactics ensure the average sheeple is too busy scratching his head over an optical illusion in their toilet bowl to notice the Glow-in-the-Dark shit all over the walls, towel rack, faucet handles, vanity mirror, etc.
