OFFICIAL F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ WORDBRIEF MEMO#77189219 

Your objective is to set up pipeline infrastructure for the freshwater ocean drain, and lay groundwork for long term ocean floor strip mining (AKA F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ CLEAN HORIZON). 

Subjugate the planet. F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ CORPORATE has obtained Q3_ZN:S*114117-P*6 for draining and mining access. As Corp Ambassadors, your goal is to reach an agreement with one of the three tribes that are indiginous to the planet. Pay as you see fit- but use discretion. The group you choose will end up doing the vast majority of the labor for the resource collecting. They mustn't rebel or resist. 

The remainder of the WORDBRIEF is inscribed in Bruydac: Operations - Sequence II
