OFFICIAL F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ WORDBRIEF MEMO#77189220 

Your objective is to set up pipeline infrastructure for the freshwater ocean drain and lay groundwork for long term ocean floor strip mining (AKA F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ CLEAN HORIZON). As Bruydac is not recognized as a legitimate planet under the ISIS Space Confederation Articles of Incorporation, you are authorized to use any means at your disposal to complete the mission. However, any military action or usage of soft genocide techniques will likely lead to unfriendly relations with the survivors, which may impede our ultimate objective in unforeseen ways: thus, a diplomatic solution is favored, and if you secure one, it will be noted in your personnel file and adequately rewarded. 

A shuttle will be sent to the planet surface upon confirmation of mission completion. In the event of a critical failure, the kill signal will be sent to your radioactive isotope capsule implant, and F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ CORPORATE AND PUBLIC RELATIONS TEAM will deny knowledge of your involvement in Bruydac planetary affairs. You are equipped with one (1) Class-3 Biowarfare Genocide Bacterium System (BGBS-3) as a last resort. This will exterminate all native life on the planet. Remember to avoid inhalation and contact with mucous membranes. Only use if you are unable to convince one or more of the clans to align with F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ CORPORATE objectives (likely).
