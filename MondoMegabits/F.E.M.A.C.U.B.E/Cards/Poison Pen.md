## "The writing tool with a nasty surprise." 

Injects the target with a full dose of neurotoxin-laced plasmids (creatures with armor or without exposed skin will not be affected). Poison Pen is an easily concealable spy tool and therefore cannot be confiscated. Poison Pen may also be used for writing. 

---------------- 

Sign Here: Inject an enemy creature with Poison Pen. 

â™¦ All moves take twice as long to complete due to onset of inexplicable dementia-like symptoms. 

Can I Borrow That?: Loan an ITEM card to your opponent.. But do not tell him that the Poison Pen is hidden underneath! Opponent suffers from brain damage (lose one (1) turn)
