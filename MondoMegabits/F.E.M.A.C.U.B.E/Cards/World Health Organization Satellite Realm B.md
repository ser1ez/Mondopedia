"OMG! Are you sick??? That's horrible. Have some corn syrup." 

Location: Big secret, but smart money's Uranus. Heh. 
Prime Directive: To study the origin and spread of intergalactic STIs 
Actual Prime Directive: Promoting interspecies marriage, encouraging alien sex; destroying earth-centric conception of "humanoid/vertebrate family.” 

Did you know that they're calling interplanetary pandemics gandemics, now? Whenever I try to pronounce it I accidentally say "gaydemic". This is a disability, okay, I'm not a bigot.

Common Intergalactic STIs: HIV:VE: Humanoid Immunodeficiency Virus: Venus Edition. Basically AIDS for lesbians; originally found in thermophilic jellies native to the Kŭmsōng Vallis. 
♦ Any female creature adjacent to another female creature is marked for death (destroyed after five (5) turns). 

Antenna Warts: You'd think humans would be immune. Unfortunately, the warts grow on your optic nerve, instead. 
♦ Any biological creature adjacent to an Aliens faction creature attacks a random target every turn for five (5) turns. WHOoties: WHOoties are an STI designed and manufactured by the WHO to depress Earthling fertility. 
♦ Turn all Male Human creatures facedown. They're useless but they take up space and cannot be replaced
