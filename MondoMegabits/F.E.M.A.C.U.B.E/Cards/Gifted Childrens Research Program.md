Children are stolen from parked cars, tents, the woods, porta-potties (they have secret maintenance hatches at the bottom) and replaced with clones via this shadow government dark op to create super soldier. Babies and children are plugged into a giant nightmarish centrifuge food-processor-looking thing that injects them with hyper-Shit and and schtem cells harvested from the past failed experiment’s dead children. 
Cybernetic tech is also added to further enhance their bodies, and thus, their ability to kill.
