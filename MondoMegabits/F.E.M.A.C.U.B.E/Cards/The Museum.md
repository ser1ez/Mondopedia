# "Now Hiring" 

The Museum is a project spanning multiple Enclaves: pockets of artificially preserved and functioning ancient civilizations tucked away from the main of society, surrounded by glades and mountains. Machu Picchu, the pyramids, the first city of Ur - all have been reconstructed and repopulated at one point as tourist destinations, serving society’s morbid fascination with tribalism. 
It’s a massive historical reenactment, except all the employees have elected to have their minds erased and forfeit all modern luxuries, and will likely die violently as a commitment to replicating the exact conditions - sacrifice, execution, brutal warfare. 
They play out the downfalls of their respective civilizations over and over again, 11:30, 1:15, 4:30, 30-minute unionized worker break, 7:30. 
When the Great Consolidation wipes out most of humanity, the Enclaves survive intact, preserved by their remoteness to howl and barter and stone on, but with better fast food options.
