"CCHHHHHHRRRRRRRRRR KKAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH BIIBIIBIIBBIIBIIBIIBIIBII" The Dial-Up Men speak only in dial-up noises. They have telephones for heads. Call them directly to activate them. The only way to stop them is to figure out their phone numbers. If you get them on the line they will join your side instead. It’s unclear what language they’re speaking but it’s not English. 
This is the call you don’t want to get late at night. 

-------------- 

No-Call List: Keep dialing random numbers on your phone until you eventually get someone to pick up. Initiate a bomb threat until the police arrive at your house.
