“Have you lost weight??” 

FunVax is a moniker for the more technical name of ‘Monsanto TGR-Injectiquile PCR-v6.10.0’ listed in the BIG PILL BOOK OF MEDICINES AND TREATMENTS (Now with quizzes!). This drug needed a desperate rebrand- sheeple hesitance was originally HIGH/VERY-HIGH due to its extreme (but worth it) side effects, but now people are excited when their DoctorNerd jabs it deep inside. 

FunVax wipes the slate clean- side effects from experimental bio-therapy, radio blasting, bio trolling and the like can stack up after a short period of daily medical interventions. Once applied, these pesky symptoms are washed away via shit/piss/puke and the subject’s illnesses remain; now easily visible to the heroic twerking 210lb Chim-Tok nurse (She’s being taken out for MIMOSAS after her 13 hour shift). Now, we can retry treatment. 

! ! Tell that ugly resident girl to bring in the MRI rifle ! ! 

SIDE EFFECTS OF FUNVAX: REMOVAL OF SIDE EFFECTS, WET SHITTING OF ALL FOODMASS, SOILING UNDERS, PEE A LOT EVERY TEN-MINUTE INTERVAL, PUKE IT ALL UP NOW, IT’S ALL THE NASTYS COMING OUT AND IT WILL BE OVER SOON! 

This injectiqule is a joy to partake in after 72 FedHours of pee-poop draining users report feeling an ‘afterglow’. Maybe they looked in the mirror and noticed they lost 10lbs. Maybe the prozac parasites being washed away makes them feel alive again. Not for long though, an appointment a day keeps they grim reaper away- see you tomorrow.
