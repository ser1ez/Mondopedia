"YOU'VE BEEN REAL BAD. ENTERING: LOCKDOWN

-- Level: ELEVATED." F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ security measure. Lockdowns come in five different threat deltas, each requiring unique safety protocols. Threat levels are relayed daily to F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ Peace Creators from the central F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ Trust, Safety and Satisfaction office. Exactly how the tiers are determined is open to speculation. 

Consequences of “ELEVATED”-level lockdown: 
• Standard detective vigilance and equipment maintenance; 
• Constant patrols; checkpoints on main thoroughfares; 
• Identity of any POIs released to media; 
• Peace Creators targeting criteria upgraded from “strike-at-will” to “strike-on-eye-contact”

LOCKDOWN_DELTA:ELEVATED: Lawful search and seizure. 
♦ Search enemy hand for items. Destroy one, keep one for yourself (You’re addicted to stealing items from perps mid-shakedown) Unregistered Tech, ELEVATED:RISK: Enemy may not enter new FAKE TECH cards into play until one tactic card is sacrificed
