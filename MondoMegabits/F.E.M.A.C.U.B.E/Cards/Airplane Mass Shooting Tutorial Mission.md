### "This is an exciting way to learn the Basics of Weapons Handling." 

You’re on a twelve-hour flight to Nippon to meet your online girlfriend for the first time in real life, when all of a sudden: A passenger stands up and screams, “I can’t take it anymore!” 

– The guy sitting next to you says, “hey man, I used to be a pilot, I know what to do.” – He gives you Basics of Weapons Handling skill points on the spot. More and more people get up and declare they can’t take it anymore-lotta stress on this flight. The gun trainer says “OK buddy you better look alive, these people are going crazy!”

– you have to shoot the rest. You kill everyone, shooting a gay flight attendant in the back of the head as he’s serving someone Diet Coke. Guess he’ll never make it back to his clean apartment that has a cat, several pieces of authentic African tribal artwork, and smells like expensive soaps and candles. It’s simple to use Basics of Weapons Handling to dispatch an entire family of four who didn’t worship you the way you wanted. “Hey you might as well finish off the rest, press “G” to throw a grenade. You can hold the bottom down to ‘cook’ your grenade, just make sure you let go before it blows up in your hand!” 

– The seat belt light turns off so you are allowed to walk around the rest of the plane killing people. When you return to your seat, if you don’t kill the guy, he looks at you and says, “nice work man. Hey, remember this for the rest of your life,” and then kills himself. 

The tutorial mission is the only good part, the rest of the game is just you being interviewed by lawyers and doctors and staring at cement walls/eating very bland food. ON CHALLENGE COMPLETION, COLLECT 500 TERROR POINT
