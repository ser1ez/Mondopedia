"Chips Ahoy!" 

--Cosplaying Pirate who is actually a medical doctor tasked with chipping your whole fucking block The original model apparently looked too 'dangerous and medical', (in reference to the MK I Sheeple Chipper). Yes, it did look like the pistol from Dead Space, but it's function over form, at least in this statistically-driven-prison-society-with-machine-wardens we've all taken unwilling residence in. Our solution to people’s aversion to the Sheeple Chipper is a little unorthodox. admittedly. 

- Replace medical staff with dressed-up birthday pirates. 
- Hide the Sheeple Chipper MK I inside a toy blunderbuss pirate gun, call it the Sheeple Chips Ahoyer MK II. 
- Give patient a tube with blended Chips Ahoy cereal & milk paste to suck on during procedure 
- Give patient a 2-for-$5 Family Size Chips Ahoy Cereal Coupon upon completion of procedure (Kroger only). 

Function: Sheeple Chipper is used to tag sheeple with 'Implantable ID Chip' (See: Implantable ID Chip, item) 

------------------- 

Ahoy Matey!: Dress up as a pirate and recite Jack Sparrow quotes as you pick two (2) target creatures to chip. 
♦ Sheeple = Chipped: You may now locate these creatures no matter where they are; search opponent’s discard/draw piles if need be, just find them!

♦ Disable Fingers: Target creature is incapable of using items. 
♦ Disable Balls and Penis: Target creature can no longer perform sex or rape attacks (can still get fucked
