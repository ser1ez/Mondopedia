# "Nollywood's finest." 

Government Name: David Street 
Cred: Tags all over LES; Has a Double XX Posse concert tee (honestly didn't think he listened to them!!!) 
Home Address: 230 Amherst Drive Burbank, CA 91504-4206 
Notable Actions: Aerosolized a mosque full of innocent people to end terrorism once and for good (thank you very much!) Born in Kenya. Raised by Bilderberg Group daycare. Married to Big Mike. An MK Ultra alum. 
His main function is to send bombs to towns in the Middle East. Unfortunately stuck on a feedback loop right now where he’s given reward juice for blowing up Syria and approving social progress executive orders drafted and presented to him by a 22-year-old deaf homosexual Nepali Facebook project manager radfem. 

------------------------------------- 

The Clean-Up: Send — to attack any Gross Shit or BRICS creatures on the field. 
♦ 625 DMG to all targets of above-named factions. 

Weaponized Problem Solving: Using your remaining WarCreds™ credits with the Department of Defense—set up black (pun intended) ops against the opposition. 

D6 roll: 
♦ D1-2 Black Male/Mail: Costs one (1) turn. Invite an enemy creature to a party with "pizza," "hotdogs," and "walnut sauce." Enemy creature can no longer attack you, due to some compromising photos of them and Kevin Spacey which must never be made public. 
♦ D3-4 False (Black) Flag: Fabricate a terror attack, distracting all enemy creature cards for one (1) turn (equivalent to 20 years in realtime). Never forget this terror attack. If either player forgets the attack, they forfeit the game. 
♦ D5-6 Legalize Something: "If they continue to X while my Y citizens suffer, we WILL give them street signs!" -- Legalize something (anything) totally because it's a good idea and not a cheap reparation to a group of whiners who are probably deaf! +5 SW
