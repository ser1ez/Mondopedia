"YOU'VE BEEN KINDA BAD. ENTERING: LOCKDOWN -- 

Level: LOW." F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ security measure. Lockdowns come in five different threat deltas, each requiring unique safety protocols. 
Threat levels are relayed daily to F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ Peace Creators from the central F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ Trust, Safety and Satisfaction office. Exactly how the tiers are determined is open to speculation. 
Consequences of “LOW”-level lockdown: 
• Police on regular standby (binge watching TV shows in squad car); 
• Fines more likely than prison sentences for minor infractions; 
•Security staff get a snow day; guard posts set to autoguard; 
• Water and electricity temporarily cut off from penal sectors. 
(Resource management reasons. Don’t worry³)
