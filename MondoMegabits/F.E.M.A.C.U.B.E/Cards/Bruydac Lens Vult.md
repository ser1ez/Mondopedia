OFFICIAL F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ WORDBRIEF MEMO#77189215 

The planet Bruydac is occupied by three tribal clans possessing technology and tools roughly on par with early Terran Bronze Age civilizations. 

The clan most readily understandable by Terran minds is Lehns-Vult, as it is somewhat comparable to a Medieval European-style monarchical society. 

Lehns-Vult occupies the rocky highlands found in the eastern and southeastern regions of the planet’s single landmass, and is the home of the planet’s main trading/slavery hub: Göln. 
Ruled by an order of proto-religious “knights,” the feudal Lehns-Vultans are bound by a code of honor that is equally strict and illogical. 

This code, the Thalmud, dictates—or at least provides rationalization for—nearly all civic and governmental action. 
Negotiation with the Lehns-Vult is possible, but they are reportedly defensive and cautious to a degree bordering upon absurdity
