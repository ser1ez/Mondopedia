"Bro: where did the time go?" 

A sunflower seed soaked in research chemicals. A 4000-year old root worshiped by an obscure Nepalese tribe, but later stolen and implanted with nanites by Dr. Ling and his cyber-poison team. Crystals and geodes traditionally used by lawful good astrologers, now tuned to evil 5G frequencies. These are just some of the diabolical tools currently being concocted in the F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ Hollistic Hell Skunkworks. 

The latest is Daylight Savings, which is not simply a substance or drug but something more sophisticated entirely- a shared, consensual group hallucination, if you will. Metamechanically not dissimilar to the Mandela Effect or the 19th Amendment. With the snap of a finger (whose?), an hour is lost- or created. A day goes missing, the year shrinks to a mere 364 days (or is it 366?). One man on the west coast of NAMERAC, one on the east- would it shock you to learn that these men occupy two separate time “zones” entirely? With Daylight Savings, time slows to a trickle, while rushing to a lightning speed.

Seconds go by like minutes, days like hours, hours like seconds, and so on. Compound dosing of Daylight Savings can make you ‘see into the future’, but the psycho-dolphin-fuckers in white lab coats disagree on whether these visions are true premonitions or simply hallucinations. All day trippers agree: the future is on fire. Cool lingo for when you take this drug: day tripping, daylighting, ‘noonblasting, dayblasting, riding the clock, etc.
