## "Puppy abortion is a discussion I am willing to really get into." 

Make a Moral-Type argument to persuade a target. If you succeed, target will reduce their hostility factor. If you S.U.C.C.E.E.D+, target will become convinced to support your cause and assist you in carrying it out. Robots, aliens, and the innately evil are immune to Moral-Type arguments. 
Some valid moral arguments include: - Puppy abortion - MDMA treatment for the elderly - Government subsidized foreskin reconstruction - Marriage for puppets - Punch girlfriend is OK if not often - Euthanasia to escape poverty - Sensory deprivation therapy for the blind (deprive them of their other senses so they miss their sight less) 

------------ 

Try My Shoes On: Empathize with my fucked up worldview. 
â™¦ Flip a coin. 
If heads, Target creature is persuaded to no longer attack or use abilities which deal damage. 
If tails, Target creature loses one (1) turn for re-typing argument several times before posting. 
If coin lands perfectly on its edge (S.U.C.C.E.S.S.+): your argument was so great that target gives up and joins your side
