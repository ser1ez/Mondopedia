"YOU'VE BEEN REAL BAD. ENTERING: LOCKDOWN -- 

Level: GUARDED." F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ security measure. Lockdowns come in five different threat deltas, each requiring unique safety protocols. 
Threat levels are relayed daily to F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ Peace Creators from the central F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ Trust, Safety and Satisfaction office. Exactly how the tiers are determined is open to speculation. 

Consequences of “GUARDED”-level lockdown: 
• Reduced detective vigilance and equipment maintenance. Peace Creator pain prods operate at 50% power output, reducing pollution and cost to the taxgiver; 
• Horse dispatch. 
• Checkpoints in certain areas are purely performative—no time is wasted scanning Level 9 Citizensirs, for example.
