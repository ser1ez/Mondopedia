"In the future crypto is banned and the NAMERAC-buck (US dollar successor) is actually doing really really well :)" 

Two girls are on treadmills in the gym, one of asks the other: "So Julie.. do u worship the NAMERAC-buck, our great nation’s sovereign currency?" "Erhm.. No..?" Girl #1 whips out her phone and pops open DigiSnitch- the new and improved patriot app (Now on FitBitch, the No. 1. GirlQueen fitness device, GoBitch™) DigiSnitch allows users to report all sorts of traitorous infractions, such as questioning petrodollar V3 sanctity and reacting negatively to public executions. 

Seconds after submitting your TERROR REPORT, a black masked Romanian police officer adorned in PMC getup C4 breachers the glass door of the OrangeFitness™ and safe-chokes Girl #2 unconscious- dragging her out by her feet. He comes back in for the woman who reported her. 

Submit terror report? Julie will die. NO YES

--------------- 

I’m Telling: You bitch! Snitch on an opponent’s non-F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ creature causing JailDeath. You must also destroy one of your own non-F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ creatures, should you have any. 

Counter-Telling: If opponent has FedGov MyBuddy Mobile in hand, they may tattle first and shut it down- locking up one of your creatures without consequence
