A.K.A. SHers. A type of artificial human hybridized in underground CIA bases for events where human expendability is a top priority. e.g.: Sandy Hook. These Hollywood extras come pre-loaded with realistic blood. They look cute but don’t worry-they don’t feel pain and they don’t have any comprehension of mortality. Sandy Hookers have low health but player can play an unlimited amount, funding permitting. Advantages: Lifelike, no reptilian vibe. Hard to detect unless blasted with the April-2014-A pgm. Difficult to screen from the public through interrogation, due to advanced CIA/NSA GPT-4 technology. Disadvantages: Quantum Leap-style problems when they forget where they were in the script and say the wrong thing. As a result SHers avoid giving direct testimony and appearing in tragedy fundraiser videos. 

Examples: Most of the Sandy Hook actors. Adam Lambda. His new stepmom.
