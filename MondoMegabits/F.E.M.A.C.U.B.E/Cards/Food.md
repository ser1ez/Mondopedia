"Food." Most common and affordable food* item. Everyone eats this stuff, everyone feels that 'hard to describe' feeling afterwards. Ingredients: Lice Paste, Xanthum Root, Glutate, Reptile Egg (Shell), Snail Tip, Mice Feather, Ant, Dog Guck, Fly Shots 

-------------------- 

Food: Eat. 
♦ 100 HP Snack. 

Side effect: Reduced peripheral vision; altered sense of smell; metallic taste sensation that strangely does not originate from the tongue but elsewhere…. Gravity's always this heavy? It's like I'm still hungry.. But somehow I know I shall never eat again. Where am I? Will you take me to the potty?
