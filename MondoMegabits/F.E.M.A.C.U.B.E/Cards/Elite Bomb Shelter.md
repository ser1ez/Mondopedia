"The future is here! And God is it a horror show!" 

Location: Subterranean New Zealand, 14 minutes from Panera (Bread) Zestimate: $800M Design Feature: Open concept, architect-inspired, bright and spacious, sweeping cathedral ceilings, breakfast bar, home theater playing 24-hour loop of nuclear detonation footage with classical music score. What's your life worth? Dead serious, answer that question, think about it. Got a number? Okay, take that number and multiply it by 1000- that's how much the Platinum Prestige Comfort & Utility Elite Bomb Shelter sells for. 

You can't afford to survive the brimstone and damnation, and even if you could you wouldn't justify the purchase due to a fundamental lack of self worth.. The target market- the elite- they love life, they love themselves, and they have the dough to do something about it. They know it’s worth the cost. They have something you don’t have: a little self confidence, a little thing called self esteem. They also have this little thing called money, you don't have any of that either. 

------------------------------ 

Platinum Prestige Protection: Place up to three (3) creatures in Elite Bomb Shelter to protect them from DMG. 
♦ Sheltered creatures can still use abilities inside Elite Bomb Shelter, but they cannot affect the outside world (they may heal each other, apply buffs/lotion, charge attacks for a later turn, etc.) 
♦ Elite Bomb Shelter has 2000 HP, if destroyed it will kill all occupants instantly. 
♦ Bomb Shelter takes 0.25X DMG from explosive attacks (resistant). Can be lockpicked; 
♦ Moving creatures into/out of Elite Bomb Shelter takes one (1) full turn.
