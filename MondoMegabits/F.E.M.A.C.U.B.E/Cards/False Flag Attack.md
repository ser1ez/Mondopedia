"With the power of my A-R.... something something."
Florida Shooter Kid 

Really sloppy jobs done by high school stoners - like the plot of the movie Slackers. Can these lovable losers get their act together long enough to pull off the big heist?? (in this case a school shooting) Some of these attacks aren’t remotely believable. And why do they keep happening in Florida? Why is there such a high concentration of white kids with aspergers? 

--------------- 

Just As Planned: Choose any opponent-controlled creature. That creature murders the creature next to it, and one (1) randomly selected friendly creature, in what is surely an honest-to-goodness genuine spree-killing and NOT highly coordinated public theater. 

♦ F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ high chancellor of GV (Gun Vio), Senator Darth Diane Feinstein, declares enough is enough, and it’s tim eto once-and-for-all ban IGWs (IllegalGunWeapons) and CGs (CrimeGuns); 

♦ Place a Gun Control counter on all of your opponent's creatures. A creature suffering from the Gun Control debuff cannot attack with projectile weapons (even if majicka-based or otherwise clearly not involving a gun); 

♦ Opponent may pay two (2) Funding Points to purchase black market weapons (all Gun Control counters removed).
