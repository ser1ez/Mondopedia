"GeneScience™ has advanced so far that we can turn gay guys into straight guys, or we can turn straight ones into gays; we can make dogs gay, and hopefully make two dogs “do it”—even if they're both guys."

We can play God, in our Playhouse—The House of Science—A.K.A. God's (New) House. We can turn squirrels into little puppies and shit, and we can make them squirrel-trannies, and we can splice them with gay guy, and then make three gay guys’ DNA combine with a dog’s—then we make the gay guy dog chimera fuck and get pregnant, then we can evolve them 1000 years until they have tits.
