POTUS hops inside AIRFORCE³, a shoddy civilian helitour helicopter with ‘FBI CIA USA’ decals on the side. Liftoff commences, and the craft beelines for the center of Lake Mead where it will hover idly while simulating cross-ocean travel. 

“Meyers, give me the newswire. What’s the status on the Iraqi situation?” 
“Mr. President, your water initiative is doing well. Child thirst is down 1000% since January.” 
“...And the hospital?” 
“Yes sir. It has your namesake, the sign on the facade is nice and big- we even used the NCIS font you requested.” 
“Heh. Nice, Meyers! Nice.. Bingo!” 

The President exits the aircraft and is instantly greeted by little Mexican kids wearing Iraqi rags, speaking Spanish. They hug his feet as flash photos are taken. A mock ‘Taliban raid’ is conducted while he’s entering a ‘government building’- the ‘terrorists’ are death row inmates with unloaded AKs Gorilla-Glued to their hands. 
FedGov FEMACUBE secret agents dispatch the terror threat with compact HKs (trust exercise). He attends the ‘Red Sea Summit’ where all the actors that play terrorists in movies pretend to be middle eastern Heads of State. Meanwhile the real Iraq is being turned to rubble.
