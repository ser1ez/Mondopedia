OFFICIAL F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ WORDBRIEF MEMO#77189216 

The planet Bruydac is occupied by three tribal clans possessing technology and tools roughly on par with early Terran Bronze Age civilizations. 

The Xin “Dynasty,” Bruydac’s oldest clan, inhabits the hilly tropical zones in the pangea continent’s center. Their government is a complex web of vassals and councils with no clear vertical power hierarchy but instead a highly-variegated lateral structure of differently titled noblemen who appear to perform more or less the same function. 

The Xin are farmers and herders who oversee an impressively diverse assortment of xeno animals and plants. What they cannot create themselves, they trade animal powders and extracts for at Göln, oftentimes very profitably. Xin diplomacy is a balancing act but will almost certainly prove easier to navigate than diplomacy with their counterparts
