Small metallic items began rolling across factory floor (nuts & bolts, flanges, pens, etc). Then larger items, entire refrigeration units; buildings galvanized steel water piping, cars parked outside- - drawn with great force/speed toward a pile of all of the site's collective metallic objects. Witness describes formation of a silhouette resembling a —”. Every person in the factory (save for one witness) was killed by phatasm itself or falling debris- total 47 souls. Witness says after approx. ten minutes force abated and collected metal objects fell straight to the floor lifeless. Cleaning crew sent to factory site; bodies burned; found no evidence of paranormal activity — consistent with witness statement; witness euthanized off-site and properly disposed of RM-positigve sightings are reported around the globe with frequently, but with no discernable pattern.
