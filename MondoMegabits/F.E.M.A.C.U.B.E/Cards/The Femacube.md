"The paradigm shift is coming. It’s codified into the dialectic. We are the pathfinders of the dialectic. We are the vanguard of the Aufklärung." 

You know this house is safe. You are safe here. You know We will always keep you safe forever. The comfort of the F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ is the comfort of a loving mother. Your fragmented psyche will be made whole again by the AI-generated television programs which are custom calibrated to enthrall and delight you. Your stress-induced delusions of persecution will be pharmacologically treated by a platoon of armed IRS agents. You will be regularly anesthetized to prevent discomfort during your indefinite vacation. You will not need to eat or bathe anymore in the warm safety of our medically-induced coma. Your signed confession will earn you one (1) guardian angel. You will breathe a sign of relief when your material possessions are confiscated and incinerated. Ice cream flavored saline solution is Wednesday’s treat. You are not lonely because your chatroom friends are in the adjacent cells. You will never need to leave. You are safe here. You know this house is safe.
