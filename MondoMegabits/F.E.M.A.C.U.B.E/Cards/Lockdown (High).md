"YOU'VE BEEN REAL BAD. ENTERING: LOCKDOWN Level: HIGH." 

FEMACUBE³ security measure. Lockdowns come in five different threat deltas, each delta requiring unique safety & security protocols put in place. Threat levels are handed down to FEMACUBE³ Peacekeepers from the central FEMACUBE³ office. Exactly how the threat delta is determined is up to speculation. 

Consequences of High-level Lockdown: 
• Robot cops dispatched; Skyblade fleet assigned to monitor RED areas closely. 
• Officer supremacist implants switched to “always on”; 
• More frequent checkpoints. Inter-sector travel not permitted 
• Chases/active crimes are constantly live streaming via Skyblade, Good Sammies get InstaCash rewards.

♦ 2X DMG when attacking this creature; 
♦ Opponent may himself choose to surrender the creature in exchange for the Good Samaritan Instacash Reward. Opponent gains one (1) Funding Point, card is destroyed
