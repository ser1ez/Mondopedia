## "Experts say it's great for the bottom line!" 

Feeders.. there's just too many of them. Data scientists project that if populations keep rising at their current rate, Hollywood would have to make 15,000 new shows to sustain the feeder lifeforms. One show could take 1,000 feeders a full year to produce.. They haven't done too much more math but it isn't a stretch to assume this could very quickly become a resource crisis. 

These are state-of-the-art computer models these guys are using, by the way.

The solution: Stop Feeder Breeding (SFB! SFB! SFB come say it with me!). Once the science is settled, we'll rely on self hating white women and CNN celebrity doctors to spread the word.
