The machine’s sole function is to fuel itself. To do so, it will murder and consume any child in its path or donated by Planned Parenthood. Its power has been co-opted by satanic pedophiles and is now used to heat Cleon Peterson’s McMansion™.

Say Hello to HEK 293 for Me: Any creatures in play with less than 100 HP are consumed. Their remaining health is added to a creature of your choice. 

Bad Deal: You sold your soul for a nice house and car… The house looks like a drug dealer’s house and guests can tell which art pieces you picked personally because they’re the most garish and imbecilic (eight-foot-tall Peter Max ripoff painting of a DMT hallucination emanating from Jay-Z’s hair). The car is something so obvious and off-the-shelf that anyone who sees it thinks you just got money yesterday (McLaren Whatever, same one Saudi Arabia buys in bulk for party favors but of course you made it your own with a retarded pinstripe that the next owner is really gonna love, and the wheel equivalent of Osiris shoes which not only look worse but are heavier and ruin the ride quality). It’s not always sunshine and rainbows over on Team Evil but it beats being broke, I guess!
