"I wanna be a civil engineer like my daddy." - No One 

Location: The regional magnet school where they send that kid with the bugged out eyes and cold, secretive parents. Gifted & Talented program for high IQ students. 

Activities involve: 
building bridges out of marshmallows and toothpicks in rooms with no windows, remote stereotactic radiotherapy, self-directed study of ancient cultures, VR sim sneaking missions; headphones super loud playing one tone for hours; Legos. Participants typically go on to score in the top 1% of students who suffer from severe migraines and attend their DARPA-partnered college of choice. Will later claim they ‘knew they were trans’ from early childhood but no one present during that time can recall even the slightest indication they were anything other than a cripplingly autistic boy.
