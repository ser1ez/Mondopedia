# F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³

> "Taxpayer, are you lost?"

To ward off the inefficiencies of archaic 'checks and balances', **F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³** was created to reign over the FBI, CIA, NSA, SHNASA, DHS, IRS, Coast Guard, and the President. Dispatch officers are instructed to stamp and approve any initiative that crosses their desk. This is an autocracy.

Their nasty fingers are deeply interlaced in every facet of modern life: there are crisis actors at gas stations, federal agents are paid salary to hang out in chat rooms and monitor VOIP in multiplayer lobbies. Spouses are each paid **MEDIAN HUMAN WAGE** to spy on each other. Politicians are Trumanned and Mandela effected even if there is no security threat. FEDGOV runs the world, bombs the world, then bombs another planet (they aren't only doing this on Urth).

Terror Wardens are each assigned one **TAXPAYER** to KEEP IN LINE. Mathematically, this makes F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E.³ the largest employer on the planet. Their power is all encompassing, their tower is high and fortified.

- "Pick up that can."
