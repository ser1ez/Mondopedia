## Two MIT nuke theorists are placing bets

Two MIT nuke theorists are placing bets on their microscopic captives â€” little guys shrunk down with a NASA shrink ray, duking it out under the watchful 10,000x zoom of the taxpayer funded micro-nanoscope. Winner gets to prop his feet up on the power plant control panel and catch some shut eye for the remainder of the shift, loser has to stay awake and watch Netflix.

From the testing lab to the MENSA luncheon, FAKE TECH is a powerhouse of raw IQ and know-how. Nerds don't play fair, they play dirty; rather than beat your ass with melee moves, a Fake Tech brainiac is likely to distract you with a naked tits hologram before plastering your mitochondria with a cancer beam.

## Nuanced climate study and other marvels

Where would we be without nuanced climate study? How lonely would you feel without the holographic moon hanging overhead? Wouldn't you feel cold if it weren't for the nuclear glow? The nearest habitable planet is fake. The death ray is a placebo, still lethal. Dark money is much like dark matter, no one knows where it comes from or what the hell it is. Your probing questions about their funding is both xenophobic and racist. Thanks to the thinking man, thinking is optional.
