### "We're really excited about what can be done with this new technology of blockchain."
***
There are a lot of Block Chains, you know. It's not just BitCoins. I like BitCoins but I'm pretty sure some of these other Block Chains are going to beat their company. I don't understand the technologyfully but they're much more efficient. You should buy some **Corponzium Token.** Their whitepaper has really pro-looking graphic design.

**It's the Future of Money:** While **Blockchain Not Bitcoin Evangelist** is in play, at any point during your turn, any number of times, you may pay **two 2 coins** from the distributed autonomous marketing budget to increase a creature's **SWG by one 1**.

**It's the Future of Contracts:** While this creature is alive, cost to play is reduced by 50% for all cards.

**BitCoins Millionaire**: If [[Blockchain Tech]] or [[Crapto Currency]] is played while this creature is in play, **gain 50 Bitcoins**. Bitcoin is like money, but it's fake.
