> [!summary] 
> A sentient computer which represents itself visually as a shireframe facsimile of its creator. 

In late 1979, computer genius Thomas Walnuts envisioned a plan to create the world's largest commercial supercomputer after seeing a magazine ad he liked for some unrelated product. By the time he had finished Super Computer 1999 (twenty years later, in 1999), it was largely obsolete--however Sinclair Research still deemed his tape-optimized compression algorithm valuable, and stole it. This creature is their bastardized build (Sinclair lacked the tender touch of the computer's original creator).

* 2x DMG boost for tethered creature.

**Fact Bomb:** The pen is mightier than the sword, and cold hard facts are king. Weaponizing your intellect allows you to cast trippy electro facts and compuLogic against your irrational enemies. Super Computer 1999 starts spewing forth reels of dot-matrix-printed racial statistics and Lew RocKwell newsletters. 
* 75 DMG to all enemy creatures; because r*cism hurts us all. 
* +200 additional damage against Team RinkBean/The Hive cards.
