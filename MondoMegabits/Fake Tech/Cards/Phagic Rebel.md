> "When humanity was willing to tell itself the truth about AIDS - that it was a combination of GRID and dysentery, the result of the WHO salvaging some topspin on a huge back-fucking epidemic - the dream of HIV was put to rest and a new era of hyperincubated, magna-effective DYNA-AIDS was made possible." 


The **Phagic Rebel**Â is a firearm that turns your immune system against you, destroying first you eyes.. Then your circulatory system and muscles <via humeric & cytosolic amino acid receptors>. The bio-bullets aren't cheap, only sold in Cold War 2 BRICS countries where they were deployed by top-level assassins.

Banned in 2041 by Geneva Convention DAO, this gun is rare at best - likely just a myth by now... Well, actually there's one on display for a limited time at the 'We Won AGain: WWIII Battle Museum' in the nation's capitol (Tampa). Being shot by this weapon is a ====certain death sentence====... **Unless treated quickly.**

-----------

**Free Harvey Oswald**: Dindu nuffin. I heard it was the Mafia. 
* Fire the Phagic Rebel at a biological creature; 
* On next turn: affected creature has a chance to remove poison if they have a healer ally/poison removal item/PrEP; 
* One turn later: creature loses eyesight (flip a coin to land attacks); 
* After final (hospice) turn: creature drops dead of Dyna-AIDS.

**Unlikely Restock:** You know a guy who knows a guy who is cousins with some dog-mutt slav who is married to a former KGB defector who used to sell poppy in Petersburg who has a nephew that can get Phagic rounds, but it'll cost an arm and a limb. 
* If you have a BRICS creature in play, you can buy another bullet for 200 HP (any friendly creature may make the sacrifice).
