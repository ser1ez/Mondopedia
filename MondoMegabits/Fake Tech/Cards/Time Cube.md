Recharged by moon-sun light aether synergy rays, fine tuned by the day/night cycle of our humble terra. If you try to debunk my theory about aether tuning you literally can't debunk it no matter how hard you try because I've already thought about it and did all relevant math regarding the subject and hold seniority because I have taught phys-ed. for over a decade.
