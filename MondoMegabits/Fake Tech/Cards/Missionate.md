**Missionate** is a $2.99 App Store application that inserts you into a fake photo with an African child (real child). The app presents you with a series of customizable sliders to control:

* EMACIATION, ASHY-NESS, BLOATEDNESS OF THEIR BELLY, DIRT IN FINGERNAILS, etc. There is a Missionate Lite app (free version) - but to encourage the full purchase, all Lite photos: 
* **INCREASE YOUR NECK FAT IN THE PICTURE (WITH ADVANCED AI).**
