***
The Mars Teleport Sci Institute is an esteemed organization full of tenured whizzes. The Institute gained most of its credibility after the founder's hit web show The Teleport Bro took off and became a satisfying classic in 2063.

## The show's premise: 
***
Doctor Doo (who would later found the Mars Teleport Sci Institute) is a 'portal genius' who made a big mistake one day. Dr. Doo flubbed some crucial math, making his teleporter unsafe for use--

#### ("That's why we.. Fact Check!")

Dr. Doo entered the portal and when he came out, there were two of him. Making the best of a sticky situation, he designated his clone 'Lil Bro' (subsequently Doctor Bro) and reamed up to host a wacky teleportation themed educational science program on SyFy-- This is a true story!
***

Doctor Doo and Doctor Bro bought a dilapidated museum and built the most profitable amusement lab in American History.

Popular activities at the Mars Teleport Sci Institute: Magic tricks, live music, Fact Check Trivia, the Goo tank, Teleport Bros Merchandise Store, Laser Torture Chamber, and most spectatcular of all: audience viewings of their teleportation tricks.

This makes the crowd go crazy. Doctor Doo and his associated once teleported an elephant to the surface of Mars, Live. The footage from their Mars Lightspeed Livefeed of the happy elephants galloping in a Mars crater turned the scientific community abuzz. Rock over London, rock on Chicago.
