**SHNASA Space Productions LLC** DBA NASNA Studios (a Saban Capital Group company).

Like all tenured and trusted scientific organizations, NASNA Studios (a proud Marvel Studios partner) is a special FX studio/amusement park/money laundering powerhouse. A typical day at NASNA Studios (a Council on Foreign Relations Bronze Member) <u>goes something like this:</u>

Eight (8) dudes in [[Active Camo]] starfield morph suits are holding up giant foam balls painted like planets that they flip and toss like sign-spinners outside a tax prep office. Director tells them they're spinning too repetitively-need to very the moves so that people watching the Space Channel don't get bored. One guy gets fired for wearing a different suit because the NASNA one is polyester (he's allergic-the DoP, Halyna Hutchins, says his personal suit is too reflective). He gathers his belongings from his locker and is shot in the head with a real-bullet-firing prop gun at the exit (knows too much); one of the PAs gets splattered with brains and is told to list a new job opening on Indeed.

A manager comes out of the NASNA Gift Shop and makes a stink about skull fragments getting mixed in with the bins of geodes and polished mineral nuggets for sale-proceeds to mop up blood with a novelty 'Mars 2: Discovery' t-shirt. Video editor looking up tutorials on how to key the color green out of footage on YouTube-clicks a TryGuys Fauci Interview instead. New shipment of Chicom-grown Red Delicious apples is dropped off in the loading bay; an intern spraypaints them purple and dips them in glitter. Apples are put in the gift shop under a sign that reads:

> [!danger] 
> Authentic Mars Grown Apples, Tastes like Space! <$58 for 2>
