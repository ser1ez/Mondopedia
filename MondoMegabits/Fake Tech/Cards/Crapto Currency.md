The FEDGOV **BuckBreakingChain** was invented in 2034 following the Great Reset 2, in which all fiat hyperinflated simultaneously, globally and on purpose (same as last time). All value rushed into precious metals-with mom and pop businesses, retirees, successful artisans and craftsmen, highly paid doctors and lawyers, and the like, all rushing to take delivery of dumpsters and bread vans full of silver and gold, as we all expected they would.

It was trivially easy, of course, for the Dept. of Witches, Wizardry, and Taxation (all gov't agencies now being Harry Potter themed) to get their mitts on the wealth-they simply had their data scientists deleted the elements Ag and Au from science. Next on the agenda, however, was taking down Bitcoin. This could be harder than it seems...

The solution- **Crapto Currency**, FEDGOV's last-ditch attempt to regain monetary control in the face of global crisis. All **Crapto Currency** is stored on CrapApp. To spur adoption, **Crapto Currency** is proudly partnered with **UberEats** and **GrubHub**, offering 50% off at checkout with yout first Crapto payment. Somehow, these enticing offers still aren't enough to get dark web criminals, BLM terror cells, and NorKon defectors to ditch their crumbly old BTC and ape into the crypto with crappitude: Crapto. The fight to legitimize Crapto is ongoing.
