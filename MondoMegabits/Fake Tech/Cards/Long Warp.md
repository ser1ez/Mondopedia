Tour de France? Do you fancy some authentic UwU Japanese cuisine my dearest? Or shall we parlay at the Great Wall?? I have some stuff to do in Bangkok later in the day but you can't tag along for that.

**Long Warps** are not possible on consumer grade teleporters. 1000+ MILE JUMPS are reserved for those with access to prime gear. Although impressive technologically, the charge-up can take twenty minutes (or more during holiday season). [[Faction - F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E]] most wanted felon DOUG FUCKEMUP was busted while long warping - if you're not careful, you can get caught mid-jump.

**Long Warp**: Play one round of Rock-Paper-Scissors with your opponent. If you win, receive 1x Teleportation Token, giving you a free instant dodge from an attack of your choice. If you lose, discard the top card of your deck.
