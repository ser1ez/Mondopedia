> *"I'm still sentient... I think..."*


**Constructed At:** GoPuff(r) Genetic & Experiment Military Research Facility 
**Once Known As:** Ryan Simon 
**VRAM:** 256 GB

* **True phenom.** Roborg was once a cyborg half human, half robot, but his human half 'Ryan Simon' died unexpectedly. An emergency surgery was conducted--doctors replaced his human parts with robot parts. It 'worked', and the first ever roborg (half cyborg, half robot) was created.

**Roborg** suffers from some Strange Glitch, he often spouts off some sad existential jargon about how 'I am still Ryan Simon' or 'I remember everything. My first pet's name was Skip I can pass the security questions on my Steam Account,' or some bullshit like, 'we solved immortality. I'm the answer to transhumanism, please! Listen to me!' -- ignore it. There's no way a genius doctor with a PhD left a pancreas chunk or a vein in there somewhere.

Right?

--------------

**Security Protocol C: Terminate** - Roborg the Robot Cyborg identifies a threat and attacks. 
* 200 DMG. Electric shock attack. 2X DMG vs robot creatures.

**Electric Shield: Deploy** - Roborg deploys an impenetrable shield for himself and his two buddies. 
* Nothing comes in or out, attack-wise, for two (2) turns; 
* Enemies who attempt to melee attack a shielded creature take 200 DMG, big mistake.

**Listen To Me I'm Still Ryan:** It's only a glitch. Still creepy though. 
* Stun yourself for one (1) turn.
