Mark a position with your PDA Teleport App to save it like a bookmark you can return to later. Push the big red 'TELEPORT NOW! TELEPORT NOW!' button on your PDA to instantly teleport (or "requite") back to the last location you marked.

Teleporting brings an end to "your" consciousness, as you are destroyed, atom by atom, and (something very much but not exactly like) you are completely reconstituted in another place. So, not sure why you'd be OK with teleporting, other than it's very common and other people do it all the time.

**Selective Warp:** Select <u>one card of your choice</u> from your deck and recite it's name out loud. Place it back into your deck and shuffle. At any point in the game, you may sacrifice an item card to retrieve your previously selected (teleported) card and move it to your hand.

**Defective Warp:** If this card is used while enemy has a Tantillo Systems creature in play, your teleport app is hacked, compromising your warp and leaving your atoms shredded and spliced with roach DNA. 
* Instant death to a creature of enemy's choice.
