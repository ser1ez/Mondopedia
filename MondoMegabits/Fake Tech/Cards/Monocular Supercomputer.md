This little thing is such a neat little gadget. Pricey, yes but.. perfection isn't cheap.. There's a certain elegance to the iMono-Q 12 that just.. I don't know. You could buy the iMono-Q 11 Slim and save $1500, but it doesn't come loaded with Laser Eye Bubble Popper*

All those clickbait articles about the people scorching their irises out by playing Laser Eye Bubble Popper on sunny days in nonsense-people always have some wild theory about PhozeComm products. Does this thing really focus sunlight in your eye like a magnifying glass? Doesn't matter, I'm probably just gonna pop little bubbles in my closet-sized apartment that has no windows.

The iMono-Q 12 comes with the convenient [Peeping Tom] app: you can look through the monocle at strangers and up comes a nifty infotainment overlay with all publicly available (and some not) records:

TOP 5 SELFIES, CRYPTO TAXES OUTSTANDING, EMAIL EXCERPTS, RECENT BLOOD LABS.
