The first recursive robot engineers are designed with Perfect Care, granting everyone a life of luxury. They do everything for us. 
**They're Smarter Faster Better Stronger.**
All decent art & music are AI-generated--humanity's best is childishly crude by comparison. Robots work feverishly--robots don't care if nobody appreciates a painting until half a century later. Human "learning" (memorizing a wiki) is superceded by robot learning *making up new facts based on hunches about old facts). Nothing can be piloted or operated without robot assistance--it all moves too fast, too many parts, you'd just crash it and never be able to repair it. Humanity is popping pills, fucking anything with(/out) a pulse, having vicarious experiences via haptic headware memory VR--existing wholly in a downward cycle of frantic chaos.

Down time is filled with 50,000 channels of E! That automatically adapt to viewer mood. Robot-produced fads are created and expunged according to a predetermined cycle fine-tuned to maximize the amount of time humans spend on the big gerbil wheels that power the grid. Everything becomes food and food is everything; there is no scarcity, no concept of "plenty" either. There's food you can't "afford" at your current security clearance level, but in reality it's all the same product just with slightly different packaging: an illusion of scarcity to keep the various strata looking ever-upwards.
