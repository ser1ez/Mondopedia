> R&D To-Do: Figure out how to teleport without _SOUL DESTRUCTION._ 

***
You're gonna need this- it's a **R&D Hall Pass**. You now have access to everything you could possibly need: Chainguns, Flamethrowers, Lazer Mines. The villagers won't line up to be guinea pigs for the teleportation chamber of their own volition, so grab the big guns and let 'em know who's boss (Star Bao ChemChorp & Commercial Teleporter Trade Group Co., LTD)

Your job is to find the right combination of fast food & soda that one must eat before teleporting-like that nasty chalk stuff they make you drink before a major X-ray... One of the 151,964 possible food/bev combinations prevents <u>_SOUL DESTRUCTION._</u> Catering will be provided on site by every major fast food chain and carbonated beverage mfr. (this is a global team effort).

Between the deconstruction + reconstruction that occurs while teleporting, the "soul" is shattered and shredded into tiny pieces-like french fries. Imagine the soul is a **potato** on one end, then when it's on the other end it's a **large fry**. Figure out how to reverse this, at any cost, and we'll make you a rich man.
