Two (2) shwoke vaygan tranteenoids ride self-driving Segways through L.A. traffic as they smoke Cyberweed from their Bluetooth Smartbongs. Every movement down to the nervous twitch is monitored by their FitBits, Google SKIN, fingernail phones, ColonCount calorie tracker apps (it's a thing you put in your bottom, Gary Vee uses it for productivity), etc.

Both of them are pretending to pay attention to their conversation while secretly watching deepfaked beas****ity fetish porn/ageplay on their hacked Huawei Cornea Ad Displays. The porn is free because they simultaneously broadcast themselves on the PervertNetTM. They have learned to love being watched (MICROCELEBRITY); if there's no viewers in the chat, how can they prove they actually exist?

The only non-bot actually watching their "broadcasts" is a bored NSA agent, who has their cornea feeds and !"#$%porn all open in different tabs (along with a few of his own), essentially creating a Rube Goldberg machine of daisy chain voyeurism.
