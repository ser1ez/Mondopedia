> *"The future of tech-weapons was imagined to be elegant in design, but it appears to have taken on more of a slapstick aesthetic in reality."

Trench gun made by an obscure New Zealand arms mfr. It comes in two varieties that either shoot hammers with wings, or bowling-ball bolas (electrified). Used in SWAT-style breaching & clearing of Aussie pod homes.
