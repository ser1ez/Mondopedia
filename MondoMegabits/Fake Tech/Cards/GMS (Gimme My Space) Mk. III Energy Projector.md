## "Foos.. Ro.. Dah! : ) "
***
Non-lethal weapon that pushes an adjacent target back with **extreme force**. Displaces air with sonic waves to gently send crowds of protesters flying. It hits like a truck made of air. The force is equivalent to being hit by a giant airbag-an airbag with a truck inside of it.

The **GMS Mk. III** is great for getting space between you and your foes, hopefully breaking some ribs in the process.

Not for use in vents, closets, tight spaces in general.
***
**Air_BAG:** Survive one (1) vehicular attack by using the GMS Mk. III like a retrorocket... Might not work but worth a try.

**GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ME!:** A giant invisible force blasts forth, ragdolling your enemy thatta way. 
* Knocks an enemy creature 30 feet away; 
* Stunned for one (1) turn; 
* 75 DMG; 
* Affected creature cannot melee attack you again.
