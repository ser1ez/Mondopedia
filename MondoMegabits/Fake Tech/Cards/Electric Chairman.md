**CYBERNETIC CORPORATE OFFICER.** - **Electric Chairman** is a major shareholder in <u>blue chip multinational.</u> Half human, half wheelchair.

"Rolling in the dough" as they like to say (in Japanese)--because they have **LOTS of money** and **MAD wheels** that ROLL them where they WANT to go. For every dollar they make, another female in STE(A)M is <u>FIRED</u> (not for incompetence, nah nah).

Capable of <> while riding the elevator. Does TensorFlow-enhanced Diversity Policy Enforcement while waiting for the Shinkansen. Is completely unfazed by the looming global corn shortage-**Electric Chairman **figured it out while having his 3500-mile colostomy bag service done at SUPER AUTOBAGS.

To become an **Electric Chairman** you have to have the skin on your lower half degloved and then you are lowered into an ELON MUSK SMARTCHAIR.

**Disabled:** Receive Double (2X) DMG from electric attacks. Weak to EMPs. **Electric Chairman** is classified as a robot (receives robot-specific DMG).

**Y Combinator Massacre**: dollar 10,000 for 90percent of my company? I don't rike this dearl. 
* 675 DMG to Ponzi Ca$ino cards.

**I'm Gonna Need a Little Help Shitting**: *Electric Chairman* takes no DMG from Shit Attacks- he often wakes up with a caked-on shit patty glued to his abdomen so he has no fear of shit.
