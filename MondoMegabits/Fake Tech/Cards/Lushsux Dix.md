**LushSux Dix,** big time-at least that's what the haters are saying (there's a lot of them).

It's hard not to hate him, as he is the only person with a net worth over $650 to have ever touched a spray paint can. With BLOCKCHAIN MAGICKA, Lush has secured several million dollars by painting memes, effectively pulling real dollar-cash money directly out of his chafing ass (money that is always at risk of being confiscated by [[Faction - F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E]] Aussie Division TerrorCube Officers).

Talented artist, keen on the newest trends in technology-if you're an early adopter, he's earlier, and he's already painted it kissing Belle del Biden. That's why you wrote 'talentless hack go fuck yourself mate' on his latest Instagram post (YOUR COMMENT WAS TOKENIZED AND SOLD FOR 0.3 ETH. TOMORROW IT WILL BE WRAPPED FOR USE AS COLLATERAL ON THE SOLANA-BASED BOSS BULLSTM DAO. SORRY, KID).

It's not all sunshine and Lambos with Lush, though. He has a <u>secret problem</u> that all the money in the world can't fix:

**Tokenize Haters:** Usable once. Lushsux Dix can tokenize a 5 INT or lower creature, selling him on OpenSea for 250 HP. Tokenized creature is unable to act without paying hefty gas fees.

**Huff Hardcore:** If you have the Spray Paint Can item, Lush can use it to get really, really (really) high - borfing down a full fat cap blast. Incredible buff. 
* 4x DMG for next attack; 
* Lushsux Dix permanently loses 3 INT (stackable) and 100 Max HP.

**No, U Sux:** Bodyslam attack. 
* 500 DMG to target, 50 Self DMG to Lushsux Dix because tailbone (coccyx) hit curb weirdly.
