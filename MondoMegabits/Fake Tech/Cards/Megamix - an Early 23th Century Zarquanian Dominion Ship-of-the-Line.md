> **"Jeff Bezos knew what he was doing when he made that dick ship."**


**///Why do all alien ships in movies look like logs of shit?**
Is that an international marketing decision passed down to the art department? Serious question, just spitballing (this card has no effect).

**Fast Fact v1.1.1:** The Zarquans are one of the earliest space-faring races to view the females and homosexuals of their species as equal. The MEGAMIX has been helmed by a female (Zarquanian gender equivalent) captain since its maiden voyage! Awesome!

**Fast Facts v2.2.2;** Zarquanian pleasure cruisers such as the MEGAMIX aren;t all just about exotic hyperbuffets, intergalactic hedonism, getting drunk in other star systems, etc. While they do know how to party down and have a good time, the Zarquans are also extremely spiritually and philosophically advanced. In fact, much of the MEGAMIX's recreational space is set aside for advanced quantum meditation, high-level hyperintellectual theoryplay, and meta-dialoguing.

**Slaver:** The MEGAMIX was converted to a slave ship after the star anvil was destroyed (signaling the commencement of the Ten-Thousand Year Hostilities). Zarquanian slavery is more brutal and monstrous than anything we humans could ever imagine (or even have the language to adequately describe). The slaves of Zarquans must at all time be kept away from anything that can be used as a makeshift weapon-not for fear of revolt, but because the slaves will commit suicide at the first possible chance. Airlocks on the MEGAMIX are a particular point of concern for ship security.

-----------

**Fake:///]**: <u>The Zarquanian Invasion</u> is a Project Blue Beam production- yet another elaborate holographic hoax designed to distract the masses from the (all too real) Chicom/British Royal agenda. Let the opponent read the flavor text on this card, and steal real money from their wallet as they try to suss out the facts from the agitprop. They're reading this now, probably patting their pocket for their wallet.
