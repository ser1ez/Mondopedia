***"Breaking the sound barrier just got easier."***

**20x102mm - Pitney Bowes HK Hyper Primed (MAGICAL)**
* BUFF ITEM: APPLY TO ANY FIREARM.

**Compatible Weapons**: [[M197 Gatling Gun]], [[M61 Vulcan Auto-Cannon]] 
> [!warning] 
> OPERATOR WILL BECOME DEAF AND BLIND INSTANTLY. 

20mm depleted uranium rounds were already evil enough- nobody asked for this even deadlier [[Willy Wonka funhouse]] version. But [[Pitney Bowes]] doesn't wait for someone to ask. They just whip out the blueprints like [[Tony Stark]] and do their whole, iconic-but-aloof genius thing (How Do We Kill More People?).

**20mm Hyperkinteic Rounds** utilize [[electro-tech]] and [[math 3]] to make the first ever pro-sumer grade projectile cartridge that breaks not only the sound barrier, but the [[speed of light!*]] Just like fighter jets, these rounds feature compact jet engines in place of the usual chemical propellant. [[Common Misconception]]: THE BRIGHT GREEN TRAIL THAT FOLLOWS THE BULLET ISN'T WHITE PHOSPHORUS, IT'S ACTUALLY ATOMS BEING SPLIT BY THE TIP AS IT SLICES THROUGH TIMESPACE!* ====(*Mfr. claims)====

Pitney Bowes [[GadgetGeeks]] don't even fully understand themselves how 20mm Hyperkinetic Rounds work, but it's probably something to do with [[phantom photon afterimages]] being yanked through the Higgs field from the 4th or 5th dimension. Something like that.* ====(*Mfr. claims)====

20mm Hyperkinteic Rounds go in a straight line <u>no matter what</u>. If you're lucky, it's possible to obliterate a Chinese family on the other side of the planet.

**Collateral-Clip That:** Do I not have NVIDIA Highlights on? 
* Load 20mm Hyperkinetic Rounds into any firearm item;
* Fire! Attack any two (2) creatures-the bullet goes right through them for 1000 DMG each;
* **20mm Kyperkinetic Rounds**-equipped firearm is broken and unrepairable (discard it). Operator takes 250 Sight DMG and 250 Deafness DMG (permanent ringing in ears, night blindness).
