Home of the Ripper T and Crusher G product lines, HK BevLabs is an exciting company where new products are being enjoyed 24/7 by Voluntary Contractual Experiencers. Defense contractors are paired with the easy money scratch ticket class, who are paid in coupons and Bonus Gems to try energy drinks that only might cause mutations and hypertrophied body parts (shhh! Don't tell 'em that's actually the point!)

**HK BevLabs HQ** is effectively a blacksite containment zone for military experiments to create super soldiers and bio-weapons by giving gas station people and fatties 24 oz. cans of olly neon fluid ("ooze"). Pleasing taste with minor monsterism. HK BevLabs product branding is innovative and fun. Alumni of the various developmental programs really feel like they're part of the action thanks to Swag Bags, cool patches, giveaways/contests, and sweet energy-drink-styled gear with high-impact graphics and colors that really pop.

====Upcoming Product Pipeline:==== 
**BLINK190.000:** Beverage. Causes telltale W-shaped pupil/sclera in users' eyes, like cuttlefish (for low-light vision).

**EtErne:** A high-end luxury bev partnership with Moet et Chandon, comes in pebbled gold foil with stars and fleurs-de-lis - tastes of burnt rose and bull testicle. Is a superamphetamine cocktail sparingly administered to NEO (Near Earth Orbit) exoskeleton pilots.

**New Theoretical Unnamed Low-Calorie Water Facsimile**: Ground troop booster--induces massive bone density and various tissue tensile strength enhancements but needs to be paired with other energy drinks and gas station dick pills to reduce crippling inflammation and halt sepsis.
