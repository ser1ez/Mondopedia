**Best Hole**: UNDERSTANDROID Post-Session Calming Tube (ASS)

When humans fall a little short in the understandment department, Understandroid jumps on the job with gusto. As the world's best and probably first computerized listener, Understandroid can hear frequencies as low as 1 hz. Understandroid is not programmed for any violent acts (YET), but has several exploitable beta features that can make him a valuable team member in Megabits Kombat. 

--------------

Let's. Talk. About, Your. CHILD-HOOD?: 
Understandroid pulls an enemy creature aside, and gets to the bottom of why they feel the way they do. Distracted for two (2) turns. 
* Distracted enemies take a bonus 25 Gotcha DMG when hit.

**Have. You. Thought. About Why. You. Are. Be-ing. Violent.:** Understandroid successfully convinces a foe that a duel is dangerous and foolish- that they should go home and reevaluate their life, talk through their family problems instead of rushing into anger, put more effort into making their dreams come true via meditation, and carefully place healing stones atop/inside their clitoral hood/prostate/robotic oil bung (GENDER-SPECIFIC HEALING STONE TREATMENT) for several hours per day. 
* Target creature leaves field, goes to bottom of deck; 
* (Target creature must have PSI < 4.)

**E-lectric. Shock.:** Short fuse. 
* 75 DMG. There's a loose wire in the Calming Tube.
