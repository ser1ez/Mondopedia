**Most Memorable Erowid Review:** Guy dropped acid while already microflipping on MDT-3 before popping 3 Cialamin mere inches away from PLATFORM 4 (fourth plateau where you meet DMT Harry Potter).

**Go All night**: A creature on Cialamin gains one (1) extra action per female creature currently in play (females themselves cannot take Cialamin but robots, androids, demons, etc., can).
