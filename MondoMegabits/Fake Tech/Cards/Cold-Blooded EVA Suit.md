All the benefits of a traditional **EVA Suit**, but you're also invisible to **robots** and **fireproof**. Jetpack sold separately. Comes with an internal rebreather with a large supply of oxygen. **Jetpack sold separately, stop asking!**

Equipped creature can move in space with no depressurization debuffs. Helmet completely conceals face. No other Armor can be worn.

The heat-dispersing anti-bac mesh makes equipping creature fireproof/coldproof, thermally undetectable, and untargetable by robots, cameras, turret systems, the autistic, and heat-seeking missiles. AI-controlled weapons have a 50% chance to miss.

-----------

**Cold Blooded:** Equipped creature immune to heat-seeking attacks, computer targeting, etc., etc. +350 HP buff in lieu of armor bonus (it's squishy) and creature cannot be burned or frozen. +6 SWG, this suit looks really sick.
