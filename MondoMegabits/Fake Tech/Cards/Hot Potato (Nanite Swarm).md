A metallic tennis-ball-sized sphere containing a swarm of "nanites" that burst out and swarm a target on impact.

**Nanites** with quickly disperse and begin chewing down the target's weapons and gear. Nanites are incredibly fast-moving and can swim through vents to bypass airlocks. Swatting them away is futile due to self-replication and miniscule size. They know how to pick locks and ride the elevator. They're usually only visible when consuming something en masse, shimmering about in a fluttering metallic sludge form, like a school of fish in a starved frenzy.

**Nanites** are primarily used to destroy robots and chew through spacecraft hulls, breach metal doors, etc.

R**educed DMG against biological creatures.**
