This skill allows you to initiate a deep learning loop on the playback of 1 camera(s), effectively rendering it blind without alerting the SUPERVISOR that anything is awry.

<u>USEFUL FOR: </u>
B&E. Intelligence gathering. Dirty panties retrieval. Saddam-Ops.

//-Monitor C9:STATUS = Active. Threat Delta:=OmegaGreen(a) **...SCANNING FOR TERROR.**

> No Terror Found

**//-UNSUPERVISED**: **Electric/electro attacks** and hacking may be done without telling the opposing players(s) you're doing it. Once complete <enemy creature/location/item destroyed (regardless of how many turns it takes)>, the jig is up and you must show your enemy this card.

*These moves take place during your normal moves, effectively giving you two turns at once (one regular, one clandestine) until whatever **UNSUPERVISED** objective is complete. Test this neat skill on a high HP enemy- "Oh sorry, you can't play him I actually secretly killed him."*
