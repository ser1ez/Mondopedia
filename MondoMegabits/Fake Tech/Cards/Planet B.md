**False hope hoax**

**Planet B** mysteriously appeared in the sky one day, and suddenly world history (lore) was retconned to reflect that Planet B has always been hovering above. Used to make Sheeple comply with aggressive deforestation and species extinction.

"Planet B awaits us! Liftoff in 3 YEARS 1 MONTH 13 DAYS 11 MINUTES" (There are hundreds of these signs around, all with different countdowns).

"Cats and dogs are not extinct, we have shipped them all to Planet B!" (Cats and dogs are extinct thanks to GMO RINGWORMS).

Planet B us actually a projection on a giant dinner plate floating in space. 
> [!caution] 
> (There is no liftoff). 

-----------

**Liftoff**: Once this card is drawn, all cards with odd numbered rarity rankings get launched into space (destroyed). Each player may draw half of the number of cards lost. 
* All players draw new cards. You wanted this. This is good. 
* View enemy's newly drawn hand - choose two (2) cards to remove.
