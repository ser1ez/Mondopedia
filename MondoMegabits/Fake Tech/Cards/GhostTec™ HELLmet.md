This helmet is designed to ward off all psycho-wave emissions. While useful for deflecting telepathic attacks and ghost screams- the helmet has the added side effect of negating sponsored ad attacks. What's under the helmet is protected fully- all 85 of your IQ points are guaranteed intact, that's the 'Locked Inside" promise. Nothing in.. or out.
