> This AI-operated SmartHouse contains HUMANS underground, far beneath an impenetrable dome. The HUMANS are locked in vaults for their own safety and happiness, and 3D Artist's Renderings of apocalyptic scenes are projected onto the dome so as to nurture healthy and reasonable all-encompassing armageddon dread. If you are able to find and finish the Hidden Escape Room in time, your reward is to join the Jail Team and manipulate/toy with your former compatriots--setting off sprinklers, changing TV stations, watching via hidden camera, firecrackers in the toilets, etc.
