**Stealth Warps** are conducted in the shadows-a truly dark art concocted only by the darkest evil scientists. Much like the practitioners of MAGICKA, all scientists are Satanic P***philes (SPs).

Used in high profile assassinations, regular assassination, enthusiast assassinations, etc. A setup agent will go to the KILL SITE before the target arrives, set up the TO node (wire a geo-bleeper into existing I'mSmartDeviceTM infrastructure) and leave undetected. When the target arrives, one or more assassins enter via FROM node, make a big ol' mess, and warp back into the shadows.

> TO = Linked. FROM = Linked.
> NODESET: ///ACTIVE.

> [!attention] 
> Stealth Warps deliver a small EMP upon activation, disabling comms & surveillance.

**Stealth Warp:** An otherwise unattackable card (shielded, in hiding, in a bunker, in witness protection, etc.--and even: divine, ephemeral, time-paradoxical, non-existent, traveling at light speed, and so on (i.e., for any reason)) can now be attacked once, and with a 4X crit DMG buff.
