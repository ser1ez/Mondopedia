People always go back in time and try to explain uranium enrichment to Hitler. Why not make it easy for him guys: just create heavy water or a graphite moderated reactor using natural uranium, then extract Plutonium 239 from the spent fuel like India did. There are two such experiments under the Third Reich, the first of which failed due to boron contamination of the graphite moderator, so it's probably a soft spot for der Fuckerr. Soothingly explain to him that synthetic graphite makes it easier to separate out the boron vs natural graphite. That's how we made Fat Man. It's also why Israel is so ANNOYED by other Middle Eastern nations having any nuclear power plants,

**The Glow**: Immensely powerful but you need nation-state-level logistics and talent pool to do anything interesting. Best you can do right now is slip this item into an enemy creature's Gucci bag. Causes radiation poisoning, 25 DMG per turn (to biological creatures). Mandatory item for **steampunk sciencecore girlbosses**, who love to slowly lose everything from handling it.
