**Character:** Spend 45 minutes logging the Samsung UPC code in your **PDA** to **teleport** to any other appliance on the SmartDevice!TM network. Use a blink-style warp to move around a building or public zone quickly - moving from refrigerator to HOME BEER VENDOR. Statistics show that most Economy Warps have been to the local KRUNCHY KHICKEN KITCHUN CIGARETTE ATM.

TOASTER FULL OF ROACHES > IPHONE CHARGER > XBOX 360 SLIM > LED PARTY LIGHT > NVIDIA STREAM DECK > CHICOM-MADE MICROWAVE WITH CHICOM GERMS > Back to the toaster.

Economy warps are good for... economy folk. Those who can't afford public teleportation transit can still get around in style - thanks to all this medical-data-subsidized mass-produced crap.

**In a Flash:** Electronic items can be used as teleport nodes - for each electronic item in your possession, teleporting creature gets a **free dodge against an incoming attack**.
