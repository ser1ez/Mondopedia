**APPLY(c):** Asian-owned company with faux Swedish aesthetics. This **ultra-sleek** modern multinational mega-conglomerate/technological powerhouse corporation boasts the latest and greatest in **2MASX mobile warfare.** Drop to your knees **!!!carefully!!!** In awe of state-of-the-art **dual carbon alloy digital photon zap-stunners**.

*This is the Stum 9 my friends.*

The newest **Stüm** comes in a stunning Lava Obsidian Grey, and violently incapacitates **PERPETRATORS** for ten (10) seconds, a full three (3) seconds longer than the **Stüm 8**. With this new & improved model, rapers/criminals can no longer 'shock, drop & roll' to dislodge the electric prongs - each Shocklet has an integrated Bluetooth battery.** There's no escaping the pain.**
*Thank you, I know.*

We are also proud to announce the **Tempest. Soundwaves. Nausea**. Two (2) features in one (1): a microcomputer identifies offenders based on subtle patterns of aggressive body language, and vibrates their guts until they can offend no more. **Incapacitation/Peace of Mind** is at your fingertips, **and it even recognizes your fingerprint. ;)**

**APPLY(c) Pressure:** Your next two (2) stun attacks last twice as many turns.

**Wireless Nausea Beam (LEGAL)**: Can cause a creature to vomit up a food item used in prior turn. Cancel HP gains, inflict 25 Vomit DMG, -3 SWG (spit up all over your Helly Hansen). Use once.
