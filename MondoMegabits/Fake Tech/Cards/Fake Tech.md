A subterranean 16-mile-long roulette wheel is decked out with LED strips and solar panels plus a genius blend of HAARP and particle collider future-tech from the R&D goodie bin. Dark energy is scavenged by electromagnets big enough to disrupt the orbit of any satellite unfortunate enough to be directly overhead. Everything inside is swept by beamlazers and filtered through nanometer logic gates...

*(The Accelerator Tube is the coldest place in the universe.. Did you know this)*

199 out of 200 collision events are lost to a demonic sinkhole, the FBI seizes the rest- logging them into the 'Terror Matrix' so that they may be sadistically enjoyed at a later date. Individual elements are isolated & bombarded with Protons for ten years to verify if they're real or not. The world's fastest computer sports a compact muon solenoid pachinko processor built by Einstein's quantum anthropology ghost. Fake Tech has the world's best physicists, who whip out a dozen "((12))" or more dimensions every time you ask them a probing question about their funding.

The energy comes from Nowhere because that's where No One put it in the first place. Its two states of being are not and "are". You are to worship the quantum foam, and rub massive nuclear fragments on your ball and taint area. Is any of this real? This stuff is so small the only way to know is to take someone's word for it. What really keeps the lights on?
