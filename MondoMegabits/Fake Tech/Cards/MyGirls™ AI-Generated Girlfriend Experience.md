Our new line of body spray is jacked to the gills with CIA nanomacros designed to boost your Confidence IQ. After passing the blood-brain barrier, the NanoBits cause you to hallucinate supermodels who wink at you and bop their bums in the corners of your vision like sleep paralysis demons at all hours of the day.

**SURGEON GEMERAL'S WARNING**: Do NOT attempt to engage in sexual intercourse with MyGirls... MyGirls are for passive viewing and entertainment purposes only. Chasing or following MyGirls around corners will cause them to disappear like G-Man from Half Life.

**AMERIKKKAN PSYCHIATRICKKK ASSOCIATION WARNINGG6**: Do NOT inspect any love letters you discover from MyGirls. Looking too closely may cause the words to blur together, revealing them to be demonic sigils from Abaddon. Discontinue use of MyGirls immediately upon experiencing symptoms of cum-delusions including "P*rnjacking Gangstalking Sin-drome."

> [!important] 
> MyGirls will never whisper in your ear instructions for creating ammonium nitrate explosives.
