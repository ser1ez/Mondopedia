##### *"Hey buddy, look what I got here. Thing's loaded- I'll sell it for cheap. Ice cold baby."*
***
A bum approaches you and offers you the **Bogus Freeze Gun**-you're almost certain it's BS, but for the price...

What if it does work? And what if this shitcoin **Terradact Network** does go 150x like **Altcoin Bull Nation** (1433 subscribers) says it will? They're partnered with **Alibaba** somehow.

You've been burned before, and you've been burned again: ====FREEZER BURN====. Just like with **Terradact Network (TDN)**, your only option is to sell at a 97% loss.

> [!warning] 
> Useless item. Can only be sold for mana. 

***
**Sell Bogus Freeze Gun to Gullible Poverty-Stricken Kid:** You lie to a kid with bruises all over him and a hunger belly-he gives you every credit he has for the **Bogus Freeze Gun**.
