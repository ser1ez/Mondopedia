**"Overwhelming confidence consumes you. A will unbreakable by Gods, men, beasts -- even bullies."** *(Unless they bring up that one thing you did. You know what I'm talking about.)*

Fake it till you believe it fully, and woud risk it all to uphold your self image. **Armor of Self Confidence,** a.k.a. (BETA BUILD) EgoCondenser Cortex StimmerPro is a convenient battery-powered unit -- can be implanted into standard ballistic garb, sewn into the leather seat of a vehicle **(causes wreckless driving)**, etc.

* **Fragile to EMPs. If electricity is cut, this card is void.**
***
**Unwavering Resolve:** Impervious to attacks for the next turn. Afterwards, a lesser buff persists. 
* Take **no DMG** from mental attacks (Verbal Word Bullets, Assault Speech, psyop cards, etc.)
* When you have **less than 200 HP**, your **next attack deals 2X DMG**
* Usable once.

**Too Sure of Yourself:** Chance encounters do not go in your favor--too cocky, Lady Luck no likey. 
* **Lose all attempts** on coin flips and die rolls while this card is in play. Don't tempt fate. 
* **Wreck all motorbikes/vehicles.** Headbashed and A-pillar through the neck. Spine twisted 720deg. Was it worth it?
