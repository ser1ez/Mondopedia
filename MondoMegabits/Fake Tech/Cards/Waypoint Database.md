Atop CLASSIFIED Mountain in CLASSIFIED nests a treasure trove of teleportation data. Armed guards muck through snow and ice in sub-zero temperatures 24/7, monitoring thermal perimeter cams and keeping their bullpup rifles clean & ready to defend their hideaway at the drop of a snowflake. The stakes are high - if this lonely data center is taken, the taker gets access to all relevant teleporter coords, all to-and-from teleportation logs since 2088, biometrics for every registered user, encryption keys for the whereabouts of subterranean government basses, and who knows what else...

*The guards are dead now.*

> [!success] 
> You are the taker.

**I Hold the Keys**: Any teleportation moves/pranks are foiled by your omniscient failsafe. Deal 200 DMG to any hostile creature attempting a warp.

**What I Now Know**: Any creatures who have teleported in the last five (5) turns have their dox dropped on PortalForums, leading to intense paranoia and reluctance to teleport again in the future. Incredible psychological debuff.
