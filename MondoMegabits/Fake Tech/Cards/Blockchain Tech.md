**Real money is fake**. ====Fake money is real?==== Did you know that the FEDS can just invent NEW NUMBERS? Did you know that they can put the face of anyone they want on their coins? **Bitcoin** is secure (only known numbers), and it will only ever be printed with a B on one side and the venerable face of J-Pop legend **Suzuki Nononomo** on the other. 
**Yeah. I trade a little CRYPTO.** *(I'm a genius...)*

**Aren't You Glad It's Popular:** People you never liked now find reasons to start long conversations. Shaun wants to let you make him really rich but first you have to compress the years of economics, computer science, and game theory studying you did into a thirty-second elevator pitch and **<u>what do you mean</u>** you can't make 1000x risk free...?

**Aren't You Glad I Smoked Weed:** ====Same as above==== but you have to listen to the same speech about **Monero** and/or **Ripple**.

**Aren't You Glad I'm a Racist**: ====Same as above==== but now there's more emphasis on all the **cool Hurricane Katrina things** that are going to happen when the EBT money evaporates, less focus on protein folding coins and waterfall powered mining rigs etc.

**Aren't You Glad I'm at Least as Smart or Possibly a Little Smarter than You**: ====Same as above==== but now when you talk to the guy he's careful to let it drop (subtly, though) that he bought some and '**played around**' with it a little bit early on, very cool tech, reminds him of a little thought experiment he came up with at college while studying **journalism** or **marketing**.
