* **Manufacturer:** Black Ops II Weapons Group LLC 
* **Weight:** 8.2 lbs. <3.72 kg> 
* **Ammunition:** TungTec!TM 'Block-Flattener' Tungsten Killbolts <315,000 grain>

Incredible sound, fabulous damage. The **Gauss Rifle** utilized high-IQ round-earth magnetscience to launch a 45-pound tungsten buttplug at incomprehensible speeds, which is only possible by breaking the law of conservation of energyÂ . To optimize exit velocity, the barrel is lined with rifled voidmatter (an alloy of aluminum and negative space).

Being attacked while the **Gauss Rifle** is equipped results in ====INSTANT DEATH==== for the operator - the voidmatter is so volatile and poorly insulated that the merest jostle of vibration will create a negative space chasm that violently sucks you in like a high-altitude hull breach on an Airbus A320 that's been hijacked by Indonesian Muslim t*rrorists (they're actually just Guatemalans with a lot of hair gel-Program M.I.N.D.W.I.P.E. alumni who've been re-activated to draw attention away from something real that happened in teh Bermude Triangle).

> [!note] 
> Despite the Gauss Rifle being an incredibly high-tech weapon, it is fully mechanical and features no electronic parts. 

> [!danger] 
> CAPABLE OF FIRING IN SPACE.
