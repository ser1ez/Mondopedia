**Common Side Effects:** THINKING YOU'RE SINGING BUT YOU'RE JUST TALKING; WEIGHT GAIN; APPRECIATING CLASSICAL MUSIC THAT SOUNDS LIKE SHIT

Some sensitive souls have decided to check out early-they see the direction it's all going and have opted to coast through the decline of the empire via a gentler path.

FEDGOV now subsidizes Intelligence Blockers for anyone suffering with over 100 IQ, plus rent vouchers and snack tickets when you sign up and get drilled (fitted for tuning holes). The user's skull receives a forked metal tube, which when slightly electrified 20 Hz gently numb all the unhappy bad parts until switched off. Bye bye, racism! Beware though, you might just become to dumb to remember there's a kid-sized taser in your noggin! Many users don't recalibrate until the battery dies, forgetting that there's two electric spikes shoved deep inside...

45% of Intelligence Blockers recipients surveyed claim to have experienced better mood, lower stress levels and overall improvement in day-to-day life. 55% didn't understand the question.

**Metal Tuning Fork: Brain-Perfect**: Stab a creature in the head with the FDA-approved clinical device:

-   75 DMG
-   Decreases enemy creature's INT by 7;
-   If creature's resulting INT is < 0, creature becomes frenzied (must attack or perform action on a randomly selected target every turn until destroyed).
