Much like assault gun-bullets, these are lethal on the playground. Words hurt- bad. Comments about B.O./WEIGHT/UNDERDEVELOPED FACIAL STRUCTURE/UGLY GIRLFRIEND hit like flechette shells. Meanwords tear deep into your enemy's fragile heart, twisting their Jokered psyche. Thank God these things are illegal.
