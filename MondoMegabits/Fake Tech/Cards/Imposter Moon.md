A reflective plate (colloidal silver? Mylar XL army survival blanket?) has been affixed to the side of an M-type asteroid orbiting Urth, which then projects light against a solar sail, resulting in an illusion we call "The Moon." The giant contraption cleverly conceals the real conspiracy--an underground (under the ground of the asteroid, that is) labor camp/detention facility for Urth's former occupants, the TELAHians, who have been punitively incarcerated for 70,000 years for the unforgivable crime of sharing ascension technology (binaural beats, horoscopes, neti pot, etc.) with Mankind. They push a massive subterranean crank wheel in circles forever. This generates 'electricity' which in turn keeps the Impostor Moon show up and running.

Rare History: There's a little dive bar up there, locals only. Crater 19, they call it. Best nebulobster this side of Andromeda-IV. Staffed by TELAHians born and raised in slavery, sure, but you'd think they were getting paid 'cause the food is just so darn delicious.
