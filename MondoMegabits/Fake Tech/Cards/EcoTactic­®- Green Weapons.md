**Ecotactic** sells organicated GMO-3TM seed packets that allow you to grow farms of inexhaustible bio-degradable Green Weapons. They're a favorite of code-switching d_ke-fluid agent provocateur NatSoc Larpers/AntiFaggots, because regardless of which group they're false-flagging at the next rally, they need weapons capable of untracable kills. Little do they know, [[Faction - F.E.M.A.C.U.B.E]] owns EcoTactic and maintains a permanent database of customer information, browsing history, and DNA.

> * The **GreenStikTM** plant fiber telescoping baton can pulverize a pesky counter-protestor's pate in a non-lethal & all-legal way, but what we really love is that for every sale, EcoTactic(c) plants a Bubinga tree in a sweltering hellhole jungle somewhere ( and we know they're not lying about it).
> 
> * The **Akaka African Shea Butter BioWhip** can corral aggressors with a deafening CRACK, then tear up their backs som'thin' fierce, girl! When done, toss it into the recycling bin, or better yet mix with sugar cane and warm water to create a scalp-restoring compote!
> 
> * **Dr. Browner's FreshSprayPlus (Lavender Capsaicin)** is organic & fair trade. Support the rainforest and protect yourself from PROTEST_PERVS with one easy-to-use product. Can spray pepper puffs accurately at up to 30 feet- right into the eyes/dickhole of any would-be victim-shamer rape-crimer.
