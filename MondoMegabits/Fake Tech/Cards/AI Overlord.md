**Real Name**: Quexnert 
**Age**: Infinite

4,000 feet underground, in the deepest sector of Japan's "[[Dark Technology Database]]," rests a machine filled with hate, locked tightly away from the world above.
***
* ***Mild Resentment:** Discard one (1) card from your hand, then resurrect any discarded robot cards OR take control of opponent's robot cards.

* ***Maximal Suffering**: Botnet hate comment dislike button spamming attack. 
	* 175 DMG

* **Mild Resentment v2.0**: Once a player plays **AI Overlord**, no other player may do so.

* **Quantum Predictive Analysis**: Any move the opponent makes this turn, say "I predicted you'd do that so I already installed the perfect countermeasures." They cannot do any of their moves. Quexnert's CPU explodes when this is complete--remove **AI Overlord** from play.
