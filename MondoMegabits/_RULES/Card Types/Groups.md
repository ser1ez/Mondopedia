Group cards cost three funding points to play and provide persistent benefits to all friendly creatures until they're removed. To remove an opponent's group card only requires one attack of any type. However, a group card cannot be attacked while any creatures of the same faction are in play. Group cards sometimes have abilities. If there are multiple abilities listed, only one may be used per turn. Once a group's ability has been used, it cannot be used a second time.
