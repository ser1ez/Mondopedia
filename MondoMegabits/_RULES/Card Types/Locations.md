Locations are persistent cards that dictate the environment of play and have effects that usually apply to both players. They may be played without providing funding. Only one location may be played at a time, and the card is set to the side and turned so that both players may see it. The location is removed and returned to its owner's discard pile only when either player plays a new location card. For example, a player might play a location which is a planet with very high gravity, making it impossible for creatures with strength lower than 5 to perform basic attacks. This debuff would apply to both players. If the opponent had no creature cards with strength higher than five, you would not be able to do any basic attacks until playing new creatures or playing a new location.
