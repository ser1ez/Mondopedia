**Polycosmic Manipulation-** the process of purposely discombobulating one or more **dominant narratives** by shuffling their various metaphysical components off to random "locations" in **collective consciousness** phase space (to free up prime real estate for other, more desirable narratives, such as "**Women Are Smart**" and "**Saxophones Are Good**"). Root cause of the noted "Mandela effect" urban legend.

The extant **(master-present) timeline** is juxtaposed against other **pure/prime timelines** so that a **narrative navigator** can isolate the most plausible and/or hardest to disprove foundational realities while trimming away the rest judiciously. Your hot girlfriend? <u>Gone</u>. Your fun and rich friends? <u>Gone</u>. The job you fucking hate? <u>Always been there, always will be</u>. **Polycosmis Manipulation** is more akin to an art like bonsai than to anything found in the hard sciences, but the end result is concrete and undeniable.

**Reversomorphification**: Flip a coin. 
* Heads: Reverse every action from the past three (3) turns. 
* Tails: Both players put back most recently drawn card, shuffle.
