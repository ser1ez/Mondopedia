Form **'BIOLOGY BLOG, Jeremy's Journey through Lab Life, 02-08-2081**':

"Nerd Night! We just got done watching the Netflix FAUCI biopic while working all day at the AIDS lab, and boy are we wound up! Dr. Klein spilled luminol all over his khakis and... haha! Wish I was having as much fun as him after work!

Maybe today I will, 'cause we're going to the NERD BAR!! NERD BAR, NERD BAR! Yeah! It's a BARCADE, get it? It has games and fun (all the fun baby games I played as a five year old) and BEER. Beer is for adults, but games are for babies! Today, I'm both. Hahah, LAB PARTY! Yeah!!!

Thanks to today's breakthrough, all we gotta do is hop in the group teleporter, and we're at the barcade in seconds! We're Sciencing!"
