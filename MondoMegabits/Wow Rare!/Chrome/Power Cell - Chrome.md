Drozel(r) is the de facto energy weapons monopoly in 2070's **Amerikkka**, thanks largely to their corporate espionage program from which flows a steady stream of cutting-edge NorKon and Chicom tech schematics.

The Drolzel(r) 6500 GelPak(r) Power Cell (really a rebadged NorKon T6 hovertank battery) is compatible with almost every energy weapon available to the consumer and prosumer markets. The cell is so ubiquitous, homebrew hackers have managed to create an entire cottage industry based around retrofitting state-issued RV mobility scooters to run off these affordable lil' guys (much cheaper than the standard 225 Scratch Ticket fee that FEDGOV charges for grid power).

**RECHARGE**: Back in business. 
* Use Power Cell to resurrect any spent electric item 
* If recharged item is a weapon, it does an additional 125 DMG.
