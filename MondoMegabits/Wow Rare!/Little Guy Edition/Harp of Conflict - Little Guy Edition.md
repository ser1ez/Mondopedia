***
An ornate crossbow that turns any normal bolt or piece of detritus into a **flaming God-phosphorus magic arrow** once chambered. Possibly nanotech, possibly magic.
***
**Origin**: Accidentally created for a cosplayer's Etsy order after sourcing materials from an Ottoman naval shipwreck found near Atlantis. **How it became enchanted is unknown**. After the cosplayer thankfully accidentally set **Dragon Con** ablaze and killed **751 cosplayers** with the magical weapon, the lead detective swiped the evidence and is currently selling it on **Silk Road 4**. His seller account profile picture is a selfie in a generic Nike golf cap with the brim lowered to conceal the eyes.

**Warfare. A sweet sweet song.**
