**A strange magnetic material, may be magical in nature. It appears to draw in various metals and trinkets as though 'twere guided by an invisible hand.**
**Strength**: 8/10
***
Can be deployed to build single-use EMP Powermagnets, or **fuck up your nuts majorly**- rub this magnet against your ballsack constantly to help get your balls erect (but watch out! **A Magnet** is not FDA-approved).

(Your blood has iron in it, when those iron atoms are magnetically charged it causes thick blood clots that increase sexual vitality for fucking- but causes serious long term numbness and Nuts DMG)
***

* **Field of Interruption:**
	* Stun a metallic/robot creature for two (2) turns
* **Enhanced Anatomy:**
	* Rub that shit on the plums to get your [[peanuts pregnant]] and primed for ten (10) turns. Nuts get hard/erect.
